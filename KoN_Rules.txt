 1 	Fundamentals

 1.1 	Every player is expected to know and understand these rules.

 1.2 	Ignorance is no excuse.

 1.3 	In game (IG) and out of game (OOG) are two vital concepts that every player 
should understand. 

 1.3.1 	When a player is in game, he will be in character, wearing the full costume 
and garb of his character. 

 1.3.2 	Players who are in game should react as their character would. 

 1.3.3 	Characters are assumed to be in game at all times. 

 1.3.4 	When a player is in game, it also means that all of his in game items, such 
as money or treasure, are also in game. 

 1.3.5 	It is strictly against the rules for a player to be in game, while his in-game 
items are stowed out of game. 

 1.3.6 	Players securing their treasure in such a manner are cheating, and will lose 
all their items. 

 1.3.7 	Players can go out of game at any time, except to gain advantage for their 
character – like in the middle of a fight or encounter.

 1.3.8 	Players should go out of game when they are going to the bathhouse, their 
vehicle, or leaving the game area for any reason.

 1.3.9 	Fluorescent or hunter orange is the color used at Kingdoms of Novitas to 
designate OOG items, areas, or individuals.

 1.3.10 	Out of game players should mark themselves with an obvious orange 
device.

 1.3.11 	At night, OOG players should ensure that they are using an orange light, or 
that they are shining a white light on their orange device.

 1.3.12 	Any objects or areas marked with hunter orange tape or flags are out of 
game.

 1.3.13 	Game Masters will frequently mark themselves or their NPCs or encounter 
areas out of game until they are ready for use.

 1.3.14 	Out of game areas marked with orange tape or flags should be completely 
avoided by players. The instant you see orange tape on an area, you should turn 
around and leave. The area is either hazardous, or is being prepared for something 
by a Game Master.

 1.3.15 	Do not scout it out, “camp”, or loiter in sight of the area – that is cheating.

 1.3.16 	When a player goes out of game, all of his in game items on his person or 
in his tent or under his bunk go out of game with him, whether or not they are 
attended.

 1.3.17 	Unattended in game items left out in the open are fair game.

 1.3.18 	Other players who see a player marked out of game should ignore him. 
Once you have determined that a player is out of game, you should leave them 
alone.

 1.3.19 	Sleeping Players: players sleeping in IG areas are considered in game, 
unless they have marked themselves or their bunk clearly with orange.

 1.3.20 	This rule only applies while game is on, so between 10 am and 2 am.

 1.3.21 	Everyone and everything is OOG when game is called off.


 1.4 	A Game hold is called when real world hazards require everyone to stop playing 
for safety's sake.

 1.4.1 	To start a Game Hold, simply yell out, as loud as you can, “GAME 
HOLD!” All players and Game Masters hearing this should immediately STOP 
what they are doing and repeat the game hold as loudly as they can.

 1.4.2 	When you hear the call of GAME HOLD, all action stops.

 1.4.3 	Players are free to talk quietly about out-of-game stuff, or to assist with the 
situation at hand as necessary. Otherwise, players should not move, adjust 
equipment, discuss in game plans, or other related things, as this is cheating.

 1.4.4 	When the situation has been dealt with, the person who called the Game 
Hold is responsible to end it. All players should be in the position they were in 
when the hold was called, holding the same equipment, and with the same 
intentions. The person who called the Game Hold, or a Game Master or other 
responsible player if that person is gone, should count down loudly, “Three, two, 
one, GAME ON!”

 1.4.5 	When players hear the call of “Game On”, they are free to act normally 
again.

 1.4.6 	Any player can call a Game Hold at any time, but please try and ensure 
you have a good reason.

 1.4.7 	If you see a person fall, they should call the Game Hold themselves, if they 
need it, as they are the one who knows if they are injured. The obvious exception 
to this would be if they are too injured to speak, in which case you should 
immediately call a Game Hold and get help. This is very unlikely, but should be 
addressed.

 1.4.8 	Other good reasons for a Game Hold include:

*	You are injured
*	You see a dangerous situation
*	Dropped glasses or other medical/ (non-costume) prosthetic devices. (Players 
who require glasses are HIGHLY encouraged to get contact lenses. If you 
MUST wear glasses, you are required to secure them to your head with a 
safety strap.)
*	Blows to the head in combat. (If you get your bell rung due to a bad hit, it is 
OK to call a hold to clear your head and recover. You should not be at a 
disadvantage because of your opponent’s illegal hit.)

 1.4.9 	If you are capable of playing on immediately, simply say “Head - play on” 
or something similar and continue.

 1.4.10 	Do not reflexively call a Game Hold every time someone takes a tumble. 
Being aware of your surroundings is just as much of a part of the game as 
everything else, and is part of what makes it “live action”.

 1.4.11 	Bad Game Holds include:

*	You fall but are not injured
*	You drop your weapon
*	You don’t agree with a rules call
*	You have lost your glasses and they were not secured to your head with a 
safety strap
*	Combat is going badly for you
*	There is no immediate danger to anyone


 1.5 	A Time Stop is a call used by Game Masters when they need something to happen 
without the player's knowledge.

 1.5.1 	When a player hears a Time Stop called, they should IMMEDIATELY stop 
what they are doing, remain stationary, close their eyes, and begin making 
meaningless noise. The object of all this is to prevent you from seeing something 
you shouldn’t yet see that would upset the plot or ruin the surprise for you.

 1.5.2 	Players in a Time Stop should not speak to each other, look around, or 
move. 

 1.5.3 	Unlike a Game Hold, players should never call a Time Stop. It is a tool for 
GMs only.

 1.5.4 	A Time Stop is ended in the same way as a Game Hold – the person who 
started it will call “Three, two, one, GAME ON!” At that point, action should 
resume exactly where it left off.


 1.6 	Safety is a paramount concern at Kingdoms of Novitas. While it ain’t golf, and 
people are frequently hitting each other with padded weapons, this doesn’t mean we 
want to see anyone injured.

 1.6.1 	Rules dealing with safety concerns always take priority.

 1.6.2 	Players ignoring Game Holds, initiating bodily impacts during combat, 
using unsafe weapons, and other such things, especially to gain advantage for 
their character, will be dealt with far more harshly than players who break other 
rules, whether knowingly or inadvertently.

 1.6.3 	Touching other players at Kingdoms of Novitas is sometimes a touchy 
issue. People who are friends and are comfortable with each other sometimes 
forget that other people, especially new players, might not appreciate a slap on the 
back or a friendly hug.

 1.6.4 	Players in game at Kingdoms of Novitas should always ask before 
initiating physical contact with another person.

 1.6.5 	Contact with boffer weapons is not physical contact.


 1.7 	In game theft: invariably, characters get the urge to steal from each other. While 
this is allowed, there are a few rules to follow.

 1.7.1 	Kingdoms of Novitas has no character skills that allow theft. If you want 
to steal from another character, you need to actually pick their pocket, empty their 
pouch, or otherwise take their items.

 1.7.2 	Only items that are in game items may be stolen.

 1.7.3 	Any item or area marked with orange ribbon, tape, or an orange glow stick 
is considered out of game.

 1.7.4 	All in game items, even though they may be in the possession of a 
character, are Kingdoms of Novitas props, and must be returned to Logistics if 
your character dies or you permanently leave the game. (Looking at it another 
way, character theft is more a matter of game props changing hands between 
characters than stealing from another person.)

 1.7.5 	Non-numbered weapons, armor, garb and equipment may not be stolen and 
must be kept within 10-20 feet of the owner if possible. (An easy example of this 
is a character that has a wooden chest that he keeps some of his belongings in. 
While the things inside that chest may be in game items, and hence fair game for 
stealing, the box itself usually is not. If you wish to steal the items inside that box, 
you may do so, but you cannot simply pick up the box and walk off with it. You 
also may not damage the box to get inside it.)

 1.7.6 	Real world personal items should NEVER be touched. Things like 
medicines, wallets/money, car keys, or cell phones are all off limits. Players who 
take these items are committing a real world crime, and will be dealt with 
accordingly.

 1.7.7 	Often, characters will want to search a cabin or building. This is allowed, 
but there is one important rule: things under bunks are out of game.

 1.7.8 	Under your bunk is the place to store things like clothes, food (in sealed 
containers), etc.

 1.7.9 	In game items should never be stored under a bunk unless the player who 
owns them is out of game. (To do so is cheating, and if a Game Master sees you 
taking in game items from under your bunk while you are in game, you will likely 
lose them.)

 1.7.10 	During a player’s NPC shift, their equipment, including their in game 
items, are out of game. (They should mark the items or their bunk clearly with 
orange tape, or an orange glow stick if it is dark to be sure.)


 1.8 	Searching players: Naturally, players will want to search the fallen for 
information, money, magic items, or treasure. Not every player wants another person 
touching them to search them, and not every person desires to have to frisk other 
players who may have hidden loot in dubious places. To deal with this potentially 
delicate issue, Kingdom of Novitas uses the following procedure for searching other 
players:

 1.8.1 	Announce your search and wait for a response. A simple declaration to the 
fallen person of “I’m going to search you now” is sufficient.

 1.8.2 	Players who do not wish to touch another player to search may simply 
begin a detailed search.

 1.8.3 	The player being searched should decide how they are willing to be 
searched – detailed search or physical search. (If they don’t want to be touched, 
they should reply with “Detailed search please”. If they are willing to allow the 
player to physically search them, they should simply reply with “Go ahead,” or 
something similar.)

 1.8.4 	If the player being searched desires a detailed search, do not touch them. 
Take a knee next to them, and begin describing your search to them.

 1.8.5 	If your search clearly and specifically describes an area where an in game 
item is carried or hidden, the player being searched is honor-bound to give it to 
you.

 1.8.6 	If the player doesn’t mind a physical search, it is your responsibility to find 
any items they have on their person, and they are under no obligation to assist you 
in any way.

 1.8.7 	If at any time either player desires a physical search to stop, they may say 
so, and the search must become a detailed search.

 1.8.8 	The player being searched also has the option to simply give up all his in 
game items when a search is declared.


 1.9 	Restraining other players: occasionally, a situation may arise in which characters 
wish to take a prisoner or a hostage, or restrain a criminal. Binding another player 
works on the same principle as searching another player.

 1.9.1 	If you do not have rope, manacles, or some other means of actually 
restraining someone, they cannot be restrained.

 1.9.2 	If both parties (captor and prisoner) agree, then go ahead and tie them up. 
They are free to try and get loose. (This option is not recommended, as most 
players have no idea how hard it is to actually tie someone up effectively. Also, it’s 
uncomfortable, and usually painful, for the person being restrained.)

 1.9.3 	If either the captor or prisoner does not wish to engage in actual restraint, 
simply tell the player they are being tied up. 

 1.9.4 	To tie up a player in this manner, loosely loop your rope or thongs a couple 
times around the captive’s wrists and leave it at that. In this case they are NOT 
free to get loose, and another player must “untie” them or role-play cutting them 
free. (The bindings don’t have to be at all tight, and the captive player should help 
by holding the rope in place.)


 1.10 	Garb: Few things can ruin the atmosphere of the game more than players with bad 
costumes (usually called “garb”).  (Sneakers, T-shirts, or jarringly modern clothes 
(such as camouflage fatigues) can completely destroy the suspension of disbelief the 
game tries to create.)

 1.10.1 	All players are required to wear garb appropriate to the game world.

 1.10.2 	Kingdoms of Novitas is a fantasy game, and not set in a specific historical 
period.

 1.10.3 	The time period of Novitas as a world for historical garb samples ends 
roughly around 1500 AD:

*	Civen: Roman Empire from 27 BCE – 610 CE.
*	Vlean and Evenandra: Medieval Western Europe from 1066 – 150
*	Great Forest and Dellin Tribelands: Central and Northern Europe from 
prehistoric – 106
*	Free Lands: anything acceptable in any other kingdom.
*	Gersh: China from 1500 BCE – 1644 CE or Japan from 250 – 186
*	Terra: 610 – 1066 Dark Ages Europe

 1.10.4 	Players portraying non-human characters are encouraged to flavor their 
garb with fantasy elements. 

 1.10.5 	Players who consistently demonstrate sub-standard garb, or who are 
wearing something jarringly anachronistic, will be removed from the game and 
given the option of continuing to play as a non-player character for the Game 
Masters, or to leave until they can correct the anachronism. Items that will merit 
this level of response include, but are not limited to:

*	Fluorescent or day-glow colors
*	Modern military clothing in cut or pattern
*	Camouflage  patterns in any form
*	Printed bandannas
*	Sneakers in any form or color
*	Modern hats
*	Visible zippers (Zippers on the insides of boots are acceptable if not obvious)
*	Cargo pockets on pants
*	Visible white socks
*	Exposed modern webbing or straps
*	Visible duct tape (Duct tape is permissible, but undesirable, on weapons only)
*	Clothing of obviously modern cut or materials
*	Nylon or zippered backpacks or satchels
*	Clearly mundane prints or logos


 1.11 	Players must be eighteen years of age or older to participate in Kingdoms of 
Novitas events.

 1.11.1 	Players ages fifteen and up are allowed if accompanied by a sibling, 
parent, or legal guardian who is over the age of twenty one. The accompanying 
adult must be a signed-in participant and must remain on-site at all times.

 1.11.2 	Any exceptions to these rules will be handled on a case by case basis by 
the Marshals.

 1.11.3 	The Marshals have the final say in matters concerning the maturity of all 
participants.

 1.11.4 	If, for any reason, someone under the age of fifteen is present, they must 
be in the immediate vicinity of a sibling, parent, or legal guardian over the age of 
twenty one at all times without exception.

 1.11.5 	The purpose of these rules are to ensure the safety of all participants 
(regardless of age) at Kingdoms of Novitas events.



1.12	This game is intended for adults over the age of eighteen and may contain adult 
themes dealing with violence and romance, among other things.

1.12.1	It is the responsibility of the accompanying adult (relative or guardian) to 
monitor what is or is not appropriate for the minor.

1.12.2	It is the sole responsibility of the accompanying adult to remove the minor 
from any scenes deemed inappropriate (without interrupting the game).

1.12.3	It is not the responsibility of KoN GMs, players, or NPCs to alter the game 
around your child. 

1.13	Flags are strips of cloth used to signify magical effects.
1.13.1	All flags must be blue.
1.13.2	All blue flags must be visible and must be at least one inch wide and roughly 
twelve inches long.
1.13.3	One flag is enough for several effects in a given area.
1.13.4	There are Seven distinct flag locations.
1.13.4.1	On a person, such as for Anti-magic Shield.
1.13.4.2	On Armor, such as for Enchance Armor.
1.13.4.3	On a Shield, such as for Enchant Shield.
1.13.4.3.1	Flags on a shield must be visible from the front of the 
shield.
1.13.4.4	On a weapon, such as for Silvershine.
1.13.4.5	Held above the head, such as for Dissipate.
1.13.4.6	On the ground, such as for Sanctuary
1.13.4.7	On a portal, such as for Magic Lock.
1.13.5	A spell is not active until the necessary flag is in place.
1.13.5.1	If a flag isn't tied in the proper location within a minute of 
casting, the spell has no effect.


 2 	Races of Novitas

 2.1 	Drakes

 2.1.1 	Drakes are dragon-like humanoids.

 2.1.2 	Drakes have no homeland, but live together in monasteries and enclaves 
throughout Novitas.

 2.1.3 	Each individual Drake exhibits a dominant color, which is indicative of 
what type of dragon they are descended from.

 2.1.4 	Drakes venerate Draconus, and acknowledge the other gods, but do not 
worship them.

 2.1.5 	Their costume requires a reptilian or amphibian facial prosthetic with 
make-up to blend it with the skin.

 2.1.6 	All exposed skin must be covered or made-up to match the facial 
prosthetic.

 2.1.7 	Their clothing tends toward ornament and rich fabrics such as velvets and 
brocades, and can be from any background, as Drakes have enclaves and 
monasteries in every land.

 2.1.8 	Costuming Difficulty: Very difficult and expensive

 2.1.9 	New players desiring to play Drakes are encouraged to seek guidance and 
advice from players who have previously done so.

 2.1.10 	All Drakes gain Racial Language: Draconic for free at first level.


 2.2 	Earthkin

 2.2.1 	Earthkin are essentially Tolkien-style dwarves for a system that does not

 2.2.2 	Earthkin are from the Kingdom of Terra.

 2.2.3 	All Earthkin must affix at least five coin sized gemstones to clearly visible 
areas of their body with adhesive.

 2.2.4 	Earthkin are also encouraged to darken their skin with grey or brown 
make-up, but this is optional.

colors and earth tones. Earthkin often wear aprons. Jewelry of metals and 
gemstones are common.

 2.2.6 	Their warriors fight with whatever they are most comfortable with, but 
they exhibit a general trend toward axes, hammers, maces and pole arms.

 2.2.7 	Costuming Difficulty: Fairly easy and inexpensive

 2.2.8 	All Earthkin gain Racial Language: Terran for free at first level.


 2.3 	Elves

 2.3.1 	Elves are long lived humanoids with pointy ears.

 2.3.2 	Wood elves are from the Great Forest and High Elves are from Evenandra.

 2.3.3 	All Elves must wear ear tip prosthetics affixed with adhesive and blended 
with the surrounding skin using make-up.

 2.3.4 	Wood Elf costume is earth tones – mostly browns and greens.

 2.3.5 	Wood Elf warriors tend to use missile weapons, bows, or two swords, and 
avoid heavy armor.

 2.3.6 	Wood Elf costuming is fairly easy and inexpensive.

 2.3.7 	High Elf costume is finery.

 2.3.8 	High Elf clothing tends to be rich and ornate rather than practical.

 2.3.9 	High Elf warriors tend to use spear, bow, or sword and shield.

 2.3.10 	High Elf costume difficulty is fairly easy, but expensive.

 2.3.11 	All Elves gain Racial Language: Elvish for free at first level.


 2.4 	Faekin

 2.4.1 	Faekin are human, Earthkin or Elvish individuals whose ancestry indicates 
a dalliance with a fae, indicated by unnaturally-colored hair and eyes.

 2.4.2 	Faekin have colors that indicate the type of fae ancestor he is descended 
from - brown for brownies, green for dryads, blue for nyads, etc.

 2.4.3 	The change to Faekin ALWAYS takes place before a character enters the 
game. Characters who do not start as Faekin at first level will NEVER change to a 
Faekin during play.

 2.4.4 	Faekin have no cities, and no homeland.

 2.4.5 	Their costume can reflect a background from any other kingdom in 
Novitas, as they are wanderers.

 2.4.6 	All Faekin are required to wear colored contact lenses and a matching wig 
or colored hair. (Facial hair must also be colored to match.)

 2.4.7 	A player must color his hair or wear a wig; you may not claim your natural 
hair color is “red enough”, nor may you be bald, but rather must be visibly 
different and unnatural.

 2.4.8 	It is never acceptable to say that your green eyes are “green enough”. 
Costume contacts are a required part of the costume.

 2.4.9 	Faekin who choose to play a character who was an elf or Earthkin before 
undergoing their change in adolescence are required to fulfill the racial makeup 
requirements of both races

 2.4.15 	Players who choose to play either Earthkin Faekin or Elvish Faekin must 
also adhere to the costuming rules of Earthkin and Elves, respectively.


 2.5 	Humans

 2.5.1 	Humans in Novitas come in three varieties: citizens of the Empire of 
Civen, barbarians from the Dellin Tribelands, and subjects of the Theocracy of 
Vlean.

 2.5.2 	Civenite costume is typical Roman or Greek garb of any class; togas, 
robes, tunics and skirts are common for men and women of any class. (The 
Empire of Civen is a Greco-Roman amalgam.)

 2.5.3 	Civen warriors tend to use swords and shields or spears. (Players are 
encouraged to draw inspiration from films like Troy, 300, Gladiator, and 
particularly the HBO series Rome.)

 2.5.4 	The Dellin Tribesman costume is typical Dark Ages northern European 
garb. Long belted tunics, furs, leathers, and kilts are all common, as is woad and 
war-paint. (The Dellin Tribelands are a Dark Ages northern European barbarian 
amalgam)

 2.5.5 	Warriors traditionally eschew shields as cowardly, but fight with whatever 
else they feel comfortable with. (Films that provide good insight into how 
Tribesmen characters should be played are Braveheart, The 13th Warrior and 
Conan the Barbarian.)

 2.5.6 	The Theocracy of Vlean is a religious medieval culture of lords and serfs. 
(Films to watch for insight into Vleanoan culture are Ladyhawke, The Name of the 
Rose, and The Seventh Seal.)

 2.5.7 	Vleanoan costume is typical medieval European garb

 2.5.8 	Only Septons have finery.

 2.5.9 	All nobles from Vlean are also Septons, but not all Septons are nobles.

 2.5.10 	It is rare that an individual from Vlean does not wear the circle of seven 
stars somewhere on their person.

 2.5.11 	All human costume tends to be easy and inexpensive, but additions like 
finery or armor can make it much more ornate and expensive. (Humans are an 
excellent choice for a first-time player.)


 2.6 	Snow Goblins

 2.6.1 	Snow Goblins are a twisted northern race, with a culture that is an 
amalgam of Oriental and Klingon elements. (Some films that give appropriate 
cultural and/or costume cues are Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Seven 
Samurai, and The Last Samurai, as well as episodes of Star Trek involving 
Klingons or Ferengi.)

 2.6.2 	All Snow Goblins share two distinct traits, white skin and long, stark white 
hair. 

 2.6.3 	Players are required to completely hide their hair under a long white wig, 
or be bald. Players may not claim that their own hair is sufficiently white. All 
exposed skin must also be covered white. (This need not be completely opaque, 
but must be noticeably lighter than even a pale-skinned person, particularly on 
the face.)

 2.6.4 	Players with facial hair must completely cover it with a white fake beard 
and moustache, or color it white.

 2.6.5 	If the player chooses to not put makeup on certain areas, such as the hands, 
and instead cover them with clothing (like gloves) they cannot remove that 
clothing unless they first apply makeup to that area.

 2.6.6 	All Snow Goblins are further required to add at least one item of additional 
costuming in the form of physical irregularities. (Unique additions and 
irregularities are highly encouraged and will help your character stand out.)

 2.6.7 	An incomplete list of acceptable physical irregularities includes:

*	Pointed ears
*	Oversized nose
*	Fangs
*	Extra limbs
*	Tail
*	Extra eye
*	Deformities (hunchbacked, etc.)
*	Horns
*	Large claws
*	Extra fingers
*	Costume contacts
*	Severe ritual scarring

(Players desiring other irregularities should first check with Props & 
Atmosphere to see if their idea is acceptable)

 2.6.8 	These irregularities in no way grant the Snow Goblin special abilities or 
penalties, and once used become a permanent part of the characters costume and 
may not be discarded later for convenience.

 2.6.9 	Snow Goblin clothing is an amalgam of oriental clothing or armor pieces, 
such as kimonos, gi, hakama, cheongsam or Buddhist monk robes.

 2.6.10 	Snow Goblin warriors fight with typical oriental weapons such as katanas 
or naginatas, as well as oddly-shaped weapons such as the Klingon Bat’leth from 
Star Trek, the war fan, butterfly knives, the moontooth shovel, or hook swords. 
(For those choosing to play a Snow Goblin, a simple Google Image search for 
“Chinese kung fu weapons” is extremely interesting and enlightening.)

 2.6.11 	Costuming difficulty of a Snow Goblin is moderately difficult and 
expensive
 2.6.12 	Difficulty depends greatly on the physical irregularities, deformities and 
mutations chosen. A player who chooses simple deformities such as fangs and 
horns will find it much easier than deformities involving prosthetics such as 
noses, extra eyes, or scarring.

 2.6.13 	New players desiring to play Snow Goblins are encouraged to seek 
guidance and advice from players who have previously done so.

 2.6.14 	All Snow Goblins gain Racial Language: Snow Goblin for free at first 
level.

characters.

expend the “newbie death” once and continue playing the same character.

character, or even create an entirely new character.

 3.7.2 	Character Amnesty may only be used between the end of the first event 
with that character, and the start of the next event that Player attends.

XP, while Levels 11 and up need 10 XP per Level. (For example: Level 10 takes 
45 XP, but level 11 takes 55 XP.)

 3.8.6 	Level is used to determine how many Skill Points a character has.


 3.9 	Skill Points are used to purchase Skills.

 3.11.1 	Players who provide to the Game Masters a Post Event Letter (PEL) may 
be eligible to receive 2 XP (claimed at the next event’s sign-in).

 3.11.2 	PELs have a 500 word minimum, and must attempt to be grammatically 
correct and free of spelling errors.

 3.11.3 	PELs in an improper format are worth nothing; ask for help from a GM or 
experienced player if you're unsure what to write.

change your character's name.


 3.14 	Characters must have a reason to be in Pinedale.

 3.14.1 	No player may start the game with rank in any kind of social organization.

from this rule, depending on the skill.

 3.14.2 	A player may choose to come from any social background common to

least one) Racial Language, Read Magic, Brew Potion, Alchemy up to Rank 5, 
and gain 20 Production Points.

 3.16.2.2 	Savants may create any scroll or potion if they have a sample to 
copy from, even if they do not know the spell. (This still requires the 
necessary available Production Points to produce).

 3.16.2.3 	Savants can copy Alchemical Formula at a cost of 2 Production 
Points and 4 coin per level of the amalgam.

 3.16.2.4 	Savants can create an Alchemical Formula from a sample at a cost 
of 4 Production Points and 8 coin per level of the amalgam. The sample is 
destroyed as part of the cost of creating the formula.


 3.16.3 	Master Craftsman

 3.16.3.1 	To earn this title, a player must gain 20 Craft Points and learn up to 
rank 5 in two of the three following skills: Weaponsmithing, Ornamenting, or 
Tinkering.

 3.16.3.2 	A Master Craftsman gains an additional 4 bonus craft points to 
apply to each month of production.  These points do not add to the coin cost 
of an item.  These points are exempt from the point limits involved in creating 
an item. (If multiple production is gained by attending fighter practices, this 
bonus applies to each instance of production).


 3.16.4 	Magical School Master

 3.16.4.1 	Players who complete this mastery may include “Master” and the 
name of their chosen school of magic in their title.  These titles are: Master 
Battle Mage, Master Necromancer, Aegis Master, Master Compulsionist, 
Master Nature Mage, Restoration Master, and Master Enchanter.

 3.16.4.2 	To earn this title, a player must learn: 20 Power Points, and all 11 
spells from a single school of magic.

 3.16.4.3 	When a Master Mage casts a 5th level spell from their mastered 
school, the spell only costs 4 power points.


 3.17 	Players must sign in every game (even if they’re only NPCing for the weekend.)

 3.17.1 	Changes to Character levels or skills may only happen at sign in, and only 
once per game.

 3.17.2 	Characters begin play for the first time with 1 copper piece per character 
level.

 3.17.3 	Production and crafting done at a character's first event has no coin cost.

 3.17.4 	Players will keep an archived duplicate of their current character sheet, and 
leave it with Logistics. (This prevents a catastrophe in the event that you lose 
your primary character sheet.)


 4 	Magic & Spells

 4.1 	Each player is allowed to define where magic comes from, as long it does not 
break other rules.  They can claim their magic comes from any source as long as it 
uses the same rules as everyone else does.

 4.2 	Spell casting is not hindered by carrying weapons or wearing armor.  (A player 
can wear plate, carry a polearm, and cast spells.)

 4.3 	All mages are limited to 20 points of power (with the exception of Ordained 
characters).  Expenditure of more than 20 points of power in any given shift in strictly 
forbidden.

 4.4 	“Convergence” occurs every six hours: 6:00am, 12 noon, 6:00pm, 12 midnight. At 
convergence, all power is restored.  Spells that have a duration of “Game Day” end at 
convergence. 

 4.5 	Spells last their full duration, unless dispelled.
 4.5.1 	Death does not end a caster's spells.
 4.5.2 	A character may dispel spells they have cast.

 4.6 	Magic is broken down into “Spells” and “Rituals”.  Rituals are more powerful 
than a single person can possibly cast without aid from external sources.

 4.7 	There are 7 schools of magic: 

*	Aegis (protection)
*	Battle (power)
*	Nature (elements)
*	Enchantments (enhancements)
*	Restoration (healing)
*	Necromancy (death)
*	and Compulsion (mind)

 4.8 	Each school of magic has 5 levels of spells with 2 spells on each level tier.

 4.9 	Casting Spells

 4.9.1 	There are two (effective) available ranges for spells: “Touch” and “Dart”. 
The target must be in range of the spell being cast to be affected by it.

 4.9.2 	Touch range spells require that the caster touch the target with their hand 
in order for the spell to take effect. This hand must be not be holding any other 
items.

 4.9.3 	It is not possible to cast a touch range spell through a foot or other 
appendage.

 4.9.4 	The caster must touch some part of the target’s body (clothing and armor 
do not hinder spell casting) and may not cast a touch range spell by grasping a 
piece of the target’s equipment.

 4.9.5 	A wounded limb cannot be used to cast magic. A player with two arm 
wounds is unable to use spells of any sort, even to heal their own wounds.

 4.9.6 	Binding a spell caster’s hands will not hinder their ability to cast touch 
range spells as long as they are able to touch the target.

 4.9.7 	“Dart” range spells require the caster to throw a tag bag (also called a 
spacket) at the target.  The tag bag must strike the target for the target to be 
affected by the spell.  If the tag bag misses, the spell is wasted, and the power is 
expended.

 4.9.8 	Tag bags are small cloth beanbags used to represent concentrated darts of 
magical force. The range of a tag bag spell depends on how far the player can 
accurately throw the tag bag.

 4.9.9 	Players are required to provide their own beanbags to use when casting 
magic.

 4.9.10 	Beanbags are constructed of cloth and birdseed so that beanbags lost 
during play will break down and prevent unneeded liter in the playing area.

 4.9.11 	The size of the completed beanbag should not exceed a tennis ball and 
should be no smaller than a golf ball.

 4.9.12 	Beanbags must be pliable and soft to prevent injuring other players when 
they are thrown. The material used to build the beanbag should be soft, smooth, 
and a have a tight enough weave that the birdseed does not spill out.

 4.9.13 	Players are not permitted to use stiff or non-biodegradable materials like 
leather, rubber, plastic, tape, or foil.


 4.9.14 	The material used to make the beanbag can be of any color, but light and 
bright colors are preferred, making them easier to find after being thrown.

 4.9.15 	The ends of the beanbag should be sewn, tied shut with string, or closed 
with cloth tape. Never close the beanbag with staples, pins, plastic ties or plastic 
tape.

 4.9.16 	Players are expected to keep their beanbags in good condition and old, 
damaged, or soiled beanbags must be removed from play.

 4.9.17 	Spells deliverable by tag bag will only take effect if the tag bag strikes the 
target or any of the equipment they are wearing or holding, including equipment 
such as armor, shields, pouches, and weapons. For this reason, a tag bag cannot be 
avoided by blocking with a weapon or shield. (Thus requiring the player to dodge 
the tag bag in order to avoid the spell.)

 4.9.18 	If the tag bag strikes another player, the ground, or other object before 
reaching the intended target, the spell goes off and affects the accidentally hit 
target.  Because of this, it is possible for the spell caster to inflict friendly fire 
damage to companions if they are less than accurate with their magic.

 4.9.19 	When a damaging magic spell strikes an object held or worn by a 
character, the damage is transferred to the area of the body where the object is 
held or located. (For example, if a character’s shield is hit by a dart from a Magic 
Swarm spell the damage is applied to their shield arm. The exception to this rule 
is Magic Strike, which requires a valid hit to take effect). All other tag bag magic, 
such as Stun or Repel Undead, has an equal effect regardless of where the target is 
hit.

 4.9.20 	Players may throw (drop, toss, etc.) tag bags in any fashion they like as 
long as they follow the general combat safety rules. 

 4.9.21 	Some spells, such as Repel Undead, create multiple darts of magic with 
one casting. The player must throw each tag bag separately and may not toss 
multiple darts in a single throw.

 4.9.22 	Casters are not allowed to carry tag bags openly in their hands unless they 
have cast a spell that requires tag bags in the last minute. It is required that tags 
bags be carried in a pouch or pocket until the tag bag spell is cast. Doing 
otherwise might mislead other players into thinking the mage is “armed” and 
ready to throw a spell, as a player with a tag bag in hand is assumed to be holding 
a glowing ball of eldritch energy!

 4.9.23 	These darts are magically created when the incant of a spell is completed, 
and have a duration of one minute from the completion of the incant. Darts that 
are not thrown after one minute elapses dissipate harmlessly into the air, and are 
wasted.
 4.9.24 	Players are always required to actually toss or throw the tag bag at their 
target; it is never acceptable to simply hold it in your hand and touch your target.

 4.9.25 	It is not required to see the target in order to cast a spell and it is 
completely legal to cast magic in the dark in the hopes the spell will find a mark. 
(Touch range spells are obviously less problematic than dart range spells when 
casting blind.)


 4.10 	Verbal Component

 4.10.1 	When casting a spell it is required that the magic user summons the spell 
by speaking an eight word (minimum) verbal incant. Each spell in the character’s 
repertoire is required to have an eight-word incant designed by the player.  Each 
spell can have a different incant but it is easier to recall the incant if the all the 
character’s spells share the same one.

 4.10.2 	It is required that the name of the spell being cast be worked into the incant 
and can count as part of the eight words.

 4.10.3 	An incantation cannot be gibberish or in bad taste, nor can it be worked 
into common conversation.

 4.10.4 	Players are required to speak incants in a clear and loud voice.

 4.10.5 	If players ten feet away from the caster are unaware a spell is being cast 
the caster is not speaking loudly enough. It is impossible for a spell caster to 
sneak a spell by muttering the incant under their breath. (It is assumed that 
casting magic creates noticeable environmental disturbances like static electricity 
or an area of frigid cold making subtle or sneaky casting of magic difficult.)

 4.10.6 	Other players cannot disrupt a spell by simply screaming louder than the 
caster. 

 4.10.7 	If, for any reason, the caster fails to finish speaking the spell’s incant the 
spell disrupts and does not go off. This includes players that are out of breath 
from running. Small interruptions like a cough or sneeze, or pauses in speaking 
for dramatic effect do not disrupt the spell.

 4.10.8 	Players are allowed to sing or chant incants as long as the song meets all 
the requirements of normal incants.

 4.10.9 	Taking damage during the verbal component negates the spell.  Taking 
damaging hits to armor and/or magic armor still counts as being damaged.  This 
doesn’t mean the points are spent, but they must begin their incant from the 
beginning.
 4.10.10 	Offensive spell effects (such as Stun or Fear) also disrupt spell casting, 
requiring the caster to restart their incant.

 4.10.11 	A spellcaster can cast spells under almost any condition: crawling, 
walking, running, or even swimming (in theory). (Players should never be in a 
situation where they are submerged in a body of water).

 4.10.12 	A character is unable to cast magic in a situation where they are holding 
their breath such as swimming underwater (see italics in 4.9.11). Gagging a spell 
caster with cloth will also render the player unable to cast magic as it is assumed 
they cannot speak loud enough to summon magic.


 4.11 	Announce Spell Effects

 4.11.1 	Once the player finishes the incant the spell is complete and they must 
inform the target of the effects. There is no way to disrupt the spell at this point. 
The mage is required to inform the target of any effects the spell has, such as 
damage, healing, duration and so on. (The target may also ask questions 
regarding the spell cast).

 4.11.2 	All of this information must be communicated in a timely manner and with 
clarity.  A target is expected to wait for a caster to explain their spell, if necessary, 
but should not be put at a disadvantage due to an ill prepared mage. Five to ten 
seconds is a reasonable amount of time for a magic user to communicate the 
effects of a spell.

 4.11.3 	If a player is new or confused, it is acceptable to call a Game Hold to 
explain the effects of the spell, but players may not abuse this rule to their 
advantage.

 4.11.4 	Confusion in the heat of battle is not an excuse for a target to ignore the 
effects of a spell.

 4.11.5 	If the target has the ability to defend himself against the spell, such as with 
an Anti-Magic Aura, they must call out “NO EFFECT!” so the mage is aware 
their spell failed. If a “no effect” call is not made, the mage should assume their 
spell took effect. (Cheating by not accepting the spell effects should result in the 
caster contacting a Game Master.)

 4.11.6 	Some spells require the use of blue flags to indicate the presence of a 
magical field or effect.


 4.12 	Expend Power

 4.12.1 	At this point the caster should make a mental note of the number of points 
required to cast the spell and subtract that amount from their Magic Power pool.

 4.12.2 	If the caster forgets the number of power points they have remaining they 
are honor bound to reduce their available power to one point until the end of the 
game day.

 4.12.3 	Players who have a hard time remembering their power point expenditure 
should keep track of it on paper or with another form of record keeping.

 4.12.4 	Once a spell is cast it remains in play until the spell’s duration expires or a 
Dispel Magic spell is cast on the target bearing the spell. Magic users may dispel 
any spell that they have cast themselves at will without having to announce it.

 4.12.5 	To dismiss a spell he or she has cast on another target, the caster must 
touch the target and remove any previously placed flags.


 4.12.6 	If the target is a conscious creature or is in the possession of a conscious 
creature, the creature or person must willingly permit the original caster to dispel 
the spell’s effect.

 4.12.7 	In this instance the target must remove the appropriate flag in place. A 
caster may not dismiss a spell he has cast without the target’s permission.

 4.12.8 	Players are not allowed to fake spell casting even if they have magical 
skills. In game, the casting of magic is assumed to create visible effects like 
glowing hands or a shroud of light that prevents “faking” a spell. This includes 
carrying blue beanbags and flags in an attempt to portray spells that are not 
actually there.

 4.12.9 	Along the same lines, players are not allowed to speak the incant for one 
spell and then call out the effects of another spell. Tactics of this nature are strictly 
against the rules and are considered cheating.


 4.13 	Spell Effect Precedence

 4.13.1 	In the case of overlapping protective effects, any spells that grant 
immunity take precedence over other spells (e.g. if a Magic Dart spell strikes a 
target protected by Battle Mastery and Anti-Magic Shield, the Magic Dart would 
be nullified by Battle Mastery and the Anti-Magic Shield would not be 
discharged).

 4.13.2 	For non-immunity spells the higher level spell will take precedence over 
the lower level spell (e.g. Aura of Reflection will take precedence over Anti-Magic 
Shield).

 4.13.3 	For non-immunity defensive abilities of the same level, the more tailored 
(specific) application of the ability will take effect over the other. (e.g. Grounding 
Wire will take precedence over Anti-Magic Shield when being hit with a Magic 
Dart from Magic Swarm.)


 4.14 	Spell Stacking

 4.14.1 	Spells or magic items will sometimes have similar or even identical 
effects.

 4.14.2 	Items or spells with the same name will not take effect at the same time. 
For example, if you cast Magic Strike on your weapon twice, you cannot then hit 
once for eight points of damage, nor can you cast Magic Armor on yourself twice 
to get four points of armor.


 4.14.3 	Items or spells with the same name also do not queue together. Casting 
Magic Strike on a weapon twice will not allow you to strike twice for four points 
of magic damage without recasting the spell between successful hits.

 4.14.4 	Items or spells with the same type of effect, but different names, will stack 
(but not queue) with each other. For example, a player casting Toughness, a level 
one Aegis spell that grants two Body points, who then drinks an Elixir of 
Toughness, an Alchemical compound that also grants one Body point, will gain 
three body points. Because the items have different names, they will stack. 
Improved or Greater versions of the same spell will not stack (e.g. Magic Armor 
and Improved Magic Armor will not stack).


 4.14.5 	Stacking items will NEVER allow a player to exceed normal system 
limits. These limits are:

*	Four damage with a single weapon
*	Two damage with two weapons
*	Four damage with a ranged weapon
*	Two damage with a thrown weapon
*	Four points of Body
*	Twenty points of Magic Power
*	Twenty Production Points
*	Five points of Physical Armor
*	Four points of Magic Armor

 4.14.6 	Stacking effects that take place simultaneously will not grant both effects. 
For example, a player casting a Magic Strike spell on a weapon poisoned with 
Claw of the Beast could NOT then call “FOUR MAGIC POISON” damage. (The 
player needs to decide if they want to continue to call poison damage for the 
duration of the Claw of the Beast poison, or use the Magic Strike spell on the next 
successful hit. Whatever the decision, the Magic Strike spell would wear off on the 
next successful hit, regardless of whether or not the magic damage got called.)


 4.15 	Creating a combination of spells or spell-like effects so that the target in question 
is completely invulnerable to all forms of damage is not permitted. For example a 
creature with Damage Requirement: Nature CANNOT have Primal Form (which 
protects them from Nature damage) cast on it. (If at any time this is attempted by a 
player or NPC, the spell goes off, has no effect, and the power points are wasted.)


 4.16 	Spell casting, like every other aspect of the game, requires that all participants 
role-play through the situation. Players that witness or are affected by magic should 
act as their character would. A character hit by a dart spell should recoil as if hit by a 
bullet even if they are uninjured. Characters witnessing a Revive should stand in awe 
of the fantastic power being displayed.


 4.17 	Potions are liquid concoctions containing the essence and power of a low level 
spell.

 4.17.1 	Potions can be made by a character with the Brew Potion ability. 

 4.17.2 	Potions take no special skill to use but are limited to spells of third level or 
lower.

 4.17.3 	To use a potion, simply role-play drinking the contents, and destroy the 
potion tag.

 4.17.4 	To administer a potion to another person, even an unconscious or dying 
person, a player must possess the skill First Aid.

 4.17.5 	All potions contain one dose, and getting multiple effects from one potion, 
or sharing the potion with another person will not work.

 4.17.6 	Potions provide their own Magic Power, and it is not necessary to 
announce that you are using one, or say an incant.

 4.17.7 	Potions are limited to touch range spells; no potion will ever grant a tag 
bag range spell.


 4.18 	Rituals are powerful magical spells too large in scope for a single mind to store 
and cast as personal magic. Rituals, sometimes referred to as high magic, are very 
rare and typically involve the creation of magic objects, magic portals, or more 
powerful versions of common spells.

 4.18.1 	Casting rituals requires special skills (outlined in character creation) 
limiting their use to more experienced or highly specialized spell casters.

 4.18.2 	They typically come in the form of several pages of written text but have 
appeared in more unique forms, such as carvings on a stone door. The text 
contains specific instruction on the process required to cast the ritual spell and 
there is no guarantee that it will be written in a clear fashion or even in a language 
the players understand. The casting requirements vary from ritual to ritual and 
almost no two are ever the same. A typical requirement is the in game collection 
of components, both rare and mundane, and often results in months of work 
before a ritual is performed.  Besides components, the ritual might also require the 
caster to conduct it in a certain spot, at a certain time, or in the presence of other 
players.


 4.18.3 	In most cases, characters do not require magical skills to search for or 
possess ritual components. A Game Master will assist players if there is any 
confusion on this point.

 4.18.4 	Once a player feels they are ready to conduct a ritual they must seek out 
the Game Master who put the ritual in play and inform them they are ready to 
proceed.

 4.18.5 	The Game Master will oversee the ritual and inform the player of the 
results, good or bad.

 4.18.6 	Failing to complete a ritual in a proper fashion can result in some 
monstrously dangerous side effects including flawed magical effects or even 
death of the characters involved!

 4.18.7 	Once a ritual is complete, all the components involved, including the 
instructions, burn away to ash. A ritual may never be cast more than once per set 
of instructions (unless specifically stated in the ritual) and players (including 
Savants) are not allowed to copy ritual instructions in order to reproduce the spell.


 4.19 	Scrolls are handwritten magical storage batteries allowing players to not only cast 
spells different than those their personal skills allow, but also do so without using 
Magic Power points.

 4.19.1 	They are difficult to make and their creation is limited to magic-using 
characters with Production points.

 4.19.2 	In order to use a scroll the character must possess the skill Read Magic and 
any pertinent Racial Language skills (as it is possible to write scrolls in languages 
other than common).

 4.19.3 	The player must have the scroll in hand and open to cast the scroll’s spell. 
The player must read the words directly from the scroll - even if they know what 
the scroll says.

 4.19.4 	It impossible to cast a scroll in total darkness or when blinded.

 4.19.5 	The scroll provides its own power and so the casting character is not 
required to have any personal Magic Power points.

 4.19.6 	The scroll typically provides its own incant and it is required the player use 
the provided incant as opposed to one of their own creation.

 4.19.7 	Other than the above exceptions, the spell on the scroll follows all the 
normal rules for spell-casting.
 4.19.8 	Once the spell is cast the scroll burns away to ash and is rendered useless. 
After using a scroll the player is required to tear up the scroll. It is not possible for 
players to create their own scrolls by copying scrolls found in game (this ability is 
reserved for characters with the Savant ability under normal production rules.)

 4.20 	Tomes of magic are, in essence, large permanent collections of scrolls.

 4.20.1 	Pages can never be added or removed from a Tome.

 4.20.2 	Tomes typically take the form of bound books but occasionally take other 
forms, such as tablets or even ornately decorated weapons.

 4.20.3 	A player requires the Read Magic skill as well as any pertinent Racial 
Language skills to make use of a Tome.

 4.20.4 	A player must possess at least one level in the school of magic represented 
in the Tome as well as the Magic Power required to cast the spell. For example, 
for a character to cast a level three spell from a Tome of Restorative magic written 
in common, they require the Read Magic skill, the Heal Body or Diagnosis spell, 
and three points of Magic Power.

 4.20.5 	The player must read the page in the Tome even if they know what it says, 
so it impossible to cast from a Tome in total darkness dark or other similar 
situation.

 4.20.6 	The player must have the Tome in hand and turned to the page of the spell.

 4.20.7 	Aside from these additional steps spells cast from a Tome follow all the 
typical rules of spell-casting.

 4.20.8 	Tomes of magic only ever contain spells from one school of magic.

 4.20.9 	Tomes typically provide their own incants and it is required the player use 
the provided incants as opposed to one of their own creation.

 4.20.10 	Unlike scrolls, the pages of a Tome do not burn away when used, allowing 
the caster to recast the spell over and over again. (The primary advantage of 
possessing a Tome is that it allows the caster to cast spells of a higher level than 
they themselves personally possess. This useful advantage combined with the 
rarity of these devices make them highly sought after objects for magic users and 
collectors alike.)


 5 	Roleplaying Skills

 5.1 	Roleplaying skills have 4 disciplines: Druid, Medium, Ordained, and Status

 5.1.1 	Each roleplaying discipline has 5 levels.

 5.1.2 	Each roleplaying skill level costs 4 skill points.

 5.1.3 	Levels 2-5 of any Roleplaying skills require GM approval.

 5.1.4 	Roleplaying skills may be revoked if a particular player is not living up to 
the spirit of the game. (Skill revocation is not made lightly, but will be done if 
necessary).


 5.2 	Druid

 5.2.1 	Level 1

 5.2.1.1 	Grants an appropriate title chosen by the player. (Typically ‘Druid’)

 5.2.1.2 	Allows the character to communicate in pidgin speak with plants & 
animals. (This does not allow the character to speak languages otherwise 
unknown to them)

 5.2.1.3 	Allows the character to communicate with other Druids (via 
walkie-talkie); sending messages “through the trees”. (The player must 
provide their own walkie-talkie.)

 5.2.2 	Level 2

 5.2.2.1 	Allows the character to cast Charm Nature once per game day.

 5.2.2.1.1 	In all other aspects, not covered by rule , this spell acts as the 
Charm spell.

 5.2.2.1.2 	This spell does not use the player’s Magic power to cast

 5.2.2.1.3 	This spell only affects creatures the following types: plants, insects, 
lesser elementals, and lower fae.

 5.2.3 	Level 3

 5.2.3.1 	Allows the character to gain 1 additional body which can exceed 
the normal player limits of four Body points. 

 5.2.3.2 	This ability brings the character’s maximum total body up to 5. 
(This is typically referred to as ‘Barkskin’.)


 5.2.4 	Level 4

 5.2.4.1 	Allows the character to throw an additional dart when the spell 
Elemental Dart is cast.

 5.2.4.1.1 	This ability is only valid when the character already knows the 
Elemental Dart spell.

 5.2.4.1.2 	If the character does not know Elemental Dart, then they may cast 
Elemental Dart once per game day, with the standard number of darts.
(Use of this spell in this way does not require Magic Power to cast)

 5.2.5 	Level 5

 5.2.5.1 	Allows the character to use the Innervation ability once per game 
day.

 5.2.5.1.1 	Innervation is treated as a spell and requires a legal incant.

 5.2.5.1.2 	Innervation is a touch range ability.

 5.2.5.1.3 	This spell restores 2 points of used Magic power.

 5.2.5.1.4 	This spell allows the target to channel more than 20 points of 
Magic power in a single game day.


 5.3 	Medium

 5.3.1 	Level 1

 5.3.1.1 	Grants an appropriate title chosen by the player. (Typically 
“Medium”)

 5.3.1.1.1 	Allows the character to communicate with spirits. (This does not 
allow the character to speak languages otherwise unknown to them)

 5.3.1.2 	Allows the character to discern if another character is holding a 
reaped spark.  The OOG call for this ability is "I am a medium, are you 
holding any sparks?"  (This question should be spoken quietly, and answered 
quietly. It is an out of game question that must be answered truthfully.)

 5.3.2 	Level 2

 5.3.2.1 	Allows the character to cast Reap Spirit twice per game day. (The 
use of this spell in this way does not use the player’s Magic power to cast.)

 5.3.2.2 	Allows the Medium to hold 2 reaped spirits at a time. (This is an 
improvement from the default of 1 for everyone else.)

 5.3.3 	Level 3

 5.3.3.1 	Grants the character an Ethereal Aura.

 5.3.3.1.1 	Ethereal Aura functions as the Disengage spell towards all spirits

victim for the purposes of the Revive spell.

 5.3.3.2.1 	A Medium of this level may lay his hand on the Reaper and the

than killing the reaper, to save someone's spark.)

 5.3.4 	Level 4

 5.3.4.1 	Grants the Speak with Dead ability, once per game day.

 5.3.4.1.1 	Speak with Dead is a touch range spell with a ten minute duration.

 5.3.4.1.2 	Speak with Dead is stopped by defenses which protect against 
magical effects.

 5.3.4.1.3 	Speak with Dead only works on characters which are dead, but not 
after their spark has moved on to the well.  (Only works from Death until 
the same time the next game)

 5.3.4.1.4 	Speak with Dead forces the target to speak truthful answers to the 
Medium's questions. 

 5.3.5 	Level 5

 5.3.5.1 	Grants the Spirit Subjugation ability, once per game day.

grants the character the ability to force the spirit to move on to the well

as an additional 20 coin to the original 20 coin stipend granted by Level 2

alchemical compounds:  Charm, Silence, Dominate, Memory Loss, 
Anesthesia, Vermin Bane, and Truth Serum.



 5.5 	Ordained

 5.5.1 	Level 1

 5.5.1.1 	Grants an appropriate title chosen by the player. (Typically 
“Septon”)

 5.5.1.2 	Players may only apply this Roleplaying skill to established 
religions, as outlined in Chapter 3.

 5.5.1.3 	Once an Ordained religion is chosen, it may not be changed at a 
later date.

 5.5.1.4 	Should the character forsake their chosen God, all Ordained 
advancement is lost, and all resulting benefits are null and void.

 5.5.1.5 	Allows the character to set up a shrine to their deity.

 5.5.1.5.1 	Shrines provide a spell effect of either “Sanctify” OR “Unhallow” 
as described in the Spell Appendix. This effect is chosen by the player, 
when the Roleplaying skill is purchased, and may not be changed at a later 
date.

 5.5.1.5.2 	Shrines can only be activated by an obvious and audible ritualistic 
action. This action MUST be witnessed by a Game Master or Marshal.

 5.5.1.5.3 	Only one shrine can be active in a single structure. (For an 
additional shrine to be activated in the same structure, the first must be 
disrupted before the second shrine can be activated.)

manipulated) to end the chosen effect.

 5.5.2 	Level 2

 5.5.2.1 	Allows a character to cast ONE of these three spells twice per game 
day:  

*	Heal Body
*	Magic Armor
*	Strength

Alternately, the character may choose to cast Dissipate once per game day.

 5.5.2.2 	The chosen spell does not use the character’s Magic power to cast. 
(The spell still requires a valid incant to cast.)

selected.

 5.5.3 	Level 3

 5.5.3.1 	Grants the character an additional 2 Magic Power points.

 5.5.3.2 	This effect allows the character to channel up to a maximum of 22 
Magic power points in a single game day. (Thus it allows the player to exceed 
the normal limits of 20 Magic Power points)

 5.5.3.3 	This effect is permanent and cannot be dispelled.

 5.5.3.4 	This effect does not require an incant.

 5.5.4 	Level 4

incant to activate.


 6 	Production Skills

 6.1 	Crafts require a monetary expenditure, and some have additional requirements of 
Magic Power, spells, props, or reagents found during play.

 6.2 	All crafted items must be signed in at Logistics before the character enters play.

 6.2.1 	Crafted items include scrolls, potions, locks, traps, weapons, ornaments 
and alchemical compounds.

 6.2.2 	These items are too time consuming to be created during play and 
therefore are always created in between game events.

 6.2.3 	Any items without the signature or marking of a GM or Logistics official 
are invalid and not to be used, purchased, or sold.

 6.2.4 	To knowingly use a fraudulent item is cheating.

 6.2.5 	Crafted items require the player to purchase or make physical 
representations.


 6.3 	The signed slip of paper that describes the object will be provided at Logistics, 
including scrolls. (Containers for potions and such will not be provided)

 6.3.1 	Potion Brewers and Alchemists provide their own bottles (or whatever 
other items needed), Weaponsmiths provide their own weapons, Ornamenters 
provide their own crafted items, and Tinkerers provide their own locks and traps. 
(Generally, the player in which the craftsman is crafting the item for will provide 
the prop if the craftsman is not creating them item for personal use.)

 6.3.2 	All crafted weapons must pass Combat and Safety inspection.


 6.4 	At sign in, the Game Master or Logistics official will ensure the character 
bringing in newly created items has the appropriate Production Points, Skills, any 
required Magic Power points, money, foci, and physical representation.

 6.5 	At sign in, in-game items worth Production Points can be turned in to make 
additional items, as if they were Production Points the character had purchased as 
skills.

 6.6 	No more than a combination of 20 Production points and 20 Craft Points can be 
crafted per character, per game.

 6.6.1 	When buying extra Production points, the player is still limited to 20 
Production points per game.

 6.7 	A player may buy extra Production points for 3 coins each, in addition to the one 
coin per Production point cost.

 6.8 	A player cannot buy extra Craft points.

 6.9 	Craftsmen can turn in Production point items, such as Potion Water, for the coin 
value to be used on their crafted items at sign in.

 6.10 	Craftsmen can turn in Craft point items, such as Weaponsmithing ingots, for the 
coin value to be used on their crafted items at sign in.


 6.11 	Scrolls

 6.11.1 	A player must have the skill Read Magic to use any scroll.

 6.11.2 	Production Points are used to make scrolls, at a cost of 1 Production Point 
per level of the spell stored on the scroll.

 6.11.3 	Logistics will provide a signed scroll describing the effects of the scroll.

 6.11.4 	Scroll paper is an in-game, lootable item that provides a one-use boost to 
Production Points.

 6.11.4.1 	Scroll paper can only be used for scribing scrolls.

 6.11.4.2 	Scroll paper will not allow the player to use more than 20 
Production Points per sign in.

 6.11.4.3 	Characters with Scribe Scroll can create their own scroll paper in 1

scroll paper per production point stored within it.

 6.11.5 	Scrolls are in-game, lootable items.

 6.11.6 	Scribe Scroll

 6.11.6.1 	The Scribe Scroll ability allows the user to create scrolls of any 
spells that the caster knows, for a cost of 1 copper per spell level and 1 
Production Point per spell level. Scribers of a scroll must (as a minimum) 
have enough Magic Power points on their character sheet to cast the spell they 
are adding to a scroll. (For example, 5 Magic Power should be enough for any 
crafter to scribe 20 production points worth of any scrolls, yet only having 1 
Magic Power on his/her character sheet would limit that crafter to making 
only level 1 scrolls for as many production points as they had.)

 6.11.6.2 	Ritual Quills are required for scrolls 4th level and higher.


 6.11.6.3 	Ritual Quills must be presented at Logistics whenever a player 
creates a fourth or fifth level scroll.

 6.11.6.4 	It is the responsibility of the player to acquire a Ritual Quill.

 6.11.6.5 	Ritual Quills do not degrade, and may be used indefinitely, barring 
loss or theft.

 6.11.6.7 	Ritual Ink is required for scrolls of 5th level.

 6.11.6.8 	Ritual Ink must be presented at Logistics whenever a player creates 
a 5th level scroll.

 6.11.6.9 	Ritual Ink has five uses when created.

 6.11.6.10 	Each scroll of 5th level consumes one use.

 6.11.7 	When the fifth level Nature spell Ley Lines is cast from a scroll, it will 
only work for the person who scribed the scroll.

 6.11.7.1 	Ley Lines scrolls will always return the caster to the same place 
that the caster has designated for normal castings of this spell.

 6.11.7.2 	It is not possible to alter the spell to allow the caster to re-designate 
the point of binding.


 6.12 	Potions.

 6.12.1 	Generally, only spells with a range of touch can be contained in a potion.

 6.12.2 	No skill is required to use a potion.

 6.12.3 	A player is not required to actually drink any liquid to simulate the effects 
of quaffing a potion.

 6.12.4 	Some potions, called “oils”, are not drunk, but instead rubbed upon the 
target object.

 6.12.5 	In order to consume a potion, a player must tear the slip of paper from 
Logistics as they role play drinking the potion or applying the oil.


 6.12.6 	Creation of a potion requires the player to provide his own container.
 6.12.6.1 	This can be nearly any small bottle or container that does not look 
too modern or anachronistic.

 6.12.6.2 	This prop must be presented and approved at Logistics at sign in.

 6.12.6.3 	Logistics will provide a signed slip of paper describing the effects 
of the potion.

 6.12.7 	Potion Water is an in-game, lootable item that provides a one-use boost to 
Production Points.

 6.12.7.1 	2 Potion Water can only be used for brewing potions.

 6.12.7.2 	3 Potion Water will not allow the player to use more than 20 
Production Points per sign in.

 6.12.7.3 	Characters with Brew Potion can create their own Potion Water in 1 
or 2 production point versions.

 6.12.7.4 	Potion Water costs 1 coin and 1 production point to make a vial of 
potion water per production point stored within it.

 6.12.8 	Potions are in-game, lootable items.

 6.12.9 	Brew Potion

 6.12.9.1 	The Brew Potion skill allows the user to create potions for a cost of 
1 copper per spell level and 1 Production Point per spell level. Brewers of a 
potion must (as a minimum) have enough Magic Power points on their 
character sheet to cast the spell they are making into a potion. (See Scribe 
Scroll for a similar example.)

 6.12.10 	The following table lists all brew-able potions and their corresponding 
spell level.

 6.12.11 	A potion of Heal Mortal Wound cannot be self-administered, and requires 
the First Aid skill to administer it to a player suffering from a Torso Wound.


 6.13 	Alchemy.

 6.13.1 	Alchemical products are interchangeably called compounds, admixtures or 
amalgams.

 6.13.2 	Compounds that take the form of a tagbag can be successfully blocked by 
a shield.

 6.13.3 	Poisons and other compounds that impact on a shield have no effect unless 
the description specifically states that they ignore or affect shields.

 6.13.4 	People unskilled in the creation of compounds can safely use them if they 
purchase the Herbalist skill.

 6.13.5 	Any character without Herbalist may only use compounds marked “No” in 
the “Skill?” column of the Alchemy item list, and may not ever use any poisons, 
including ingested poisons.

 6.13.6 	Attempts to handle poisons without the Herbalist skill result in the player 
suffering the effects of the poison.

 6.13.7 	Creation of a compound requires the player to provide his own prop to 
represent it.

 6.13.7.1 	For most compounds, this can be nearly any small bottle or 
container that does not look too modern or anachronistic.

 6.13.7.2 	This prop must be presented and approved at Logistics at sign in.

 6.13.7.3 	Logistics will provide a signed slip describing the effects of the 
compound.

 6.13.8 	Compounds above first level require a material focus (or Foci) to create, in 
addition to money and Production Points.

 6.13.8.1 	This item is a permanent aid or reagent that can be created with 
Alchemy. (Foci range from Level 1 to Level 4 Alchemy.)

 6.13.8.2 	Players must present required foci at Logistics when creating 
Alchemy compounds of second level or higher.

 6.13.8.3 	Foci cost 2 production points per level, and 10 copper coin per 
level.
 6.13.9 	Alchemical Extract is an in-game, lootable item that provides a one-use 
boost to Production Points.

 6.13.9.1 	Alchemical Extract can only be used for creating compounds.

 6.13.9.2 	Alchemical Extract will not allow the player to use more than 20 
Production Points per sign in. 

 6.13.9.3 	Characters with Alchemy 1 can create Alchemical Extract. This is a 
production point item worth either 1 or 2 production points at sign in.

 6.13.9.4 	It costs 1 coin and 1 production point to make a vial of extract per 
production point stored within it.

 6.13.10 	Compounds are in game, lootable items.

 6.13.11 	There are common compounds that any alchemist may learn to create.

 6.13.11.1 	There are other, rarer compounds that can be only created by 
alchemists possessing a special formula for the item, called Alchemical 
Formulae.

 6.13.11.2 	These Alchemical Formulae are numbered items that may appear in 
the game as loot, or be created by Savants by analyzing samples.



 6.13.12 	Alchemy items which cause damage, aside from Vial of Acid, deal Poison 
damage. Any Body damage, Limb wounds, and Torso wounds caused by poison 
damage require a Purify Spirit spell, or some other poison-nullifying effect before 
the poisoned wound or Body can be healed. (Players should call ‘no effect’ to 
Heal Body, Restore Limb, and Heal Mortal Wounds spells.)

 6.13.13 	To apply an ingested poison compound, players must place a small green 
sticker no smaller than ½ inch in diameter on the affected item.

 6.13.13.1 	The sticker must be placed on or in a food or drink container. If that 
food container is then eaten from, that person is potentially poisoned. (This is 
true unless any poison-preventing abilities are in effect on the subject.)

 6.13.13.2 	For the poison to take effect, the one who placed the green sticker 
must bring the signed Alchemy slip of the poison to a Game Master, and 
explain who was poisoned and how. The Game Master will then find victim of 
the poisoning, inform them that they are poisoned, and how long they have 
until the poison takes effect.

 6.13.13.3 	A poisoned player is aware they are poisoned.

 6.13.13.4 	If the victim of the poisoning is able to nullify the poison in his 
system, they are unharmed by the effects of the poison.

 6.13.13.5 	If the Game Master has no time, cannot find an NPC or Assistant 
Game Master to send to the player, or the poisoned player cannot be located, 
the poison has no effect, but is still expended.

 6.13.13.6 	If the duration time expires before a chemical or magical antidote is 
obtained, the Ingested poison takes effect immediately.

 6.13.13.7 	Any damage caused as a result of an ingested poison ignores armor, 
and any wounds caused are torso wounds.

 6.13.13.7.1 	Players with the skill Herbalism can identify items with a 
green sticker, if found before the drink or food is ingested.

 6.13.13.7.2 	Any player without Herbalism cannot ‘see’ the green sticker 
in-game, and must roleplay appropriately.


 6.14 	Ornamenting, Weaponsmithing, and Tinkering use Craft Points.

 6.14.1 	A player can only use 20 Craft points per game, with any combination of 
skills. (The exception to this is the Master Craftsman, who can use 24 points on 
items created from the skill tree they have mastered.)

 6.14.2 	A player may only use Craft points equaling his Crafting level times four 
on a single item, regardless of his total number of Craft points. A player may have 
Craft points greater than this amount, and may use them on multiple items. (For 
example, a Level 1 Tinkerer who is also a Level 3 Weaponsmith can put a total of 
12 Craft points towards any one weapon, and a total of 4 Craft points towards 
any one trap, even if they have 20 Craft points total available. In this case, the 
crafter would have spent 16 Craft points and could make another 4 Craft point 
weapon or trap.)

 6.15 	It is possible for a Weaponsmith or an Ornamenter to create an item with multiple 
properties.

 6.16 	Weaponsmithing costs 10 copper per Craft point.

 6.17 	Ornamenting costs 5 copper per Craft point.

 6.18 	Tinkering costs 5 copper per Craft point.
 6.19 	Crafters may only imbue their items with spells they cast themselves, either 
through use of their own magic skills or through purchased scrolls. (Other players 
may not be enlisted to imbue magic items.)

 6.20 	If a scroll is used to imbue an item with a spell, the player must have the skill 
Read Magic to utilize the scroll and then the scroll is consumed.

 6.21 	Other crafted items may not be used to imbue an item with a spell.

 6.22 	The table below lists the enhancements to items Weaponsmithing can produce:

 6.23 	Arrows, bolts, and thrown weapons that are not imbued with a spell are made in 
packs of four that are made as a single weapon when figuring cost.

 6.23.1 	Imbuing a projectile with a spell creates only one projectile with that 
enhancement, the other three projectiles created are simply Magic.

 6.23.2 	All projectiles created of a special material (Masterwork, Goblin Iron, 
Silver, Elven Steel) are created in packs of four of the special material.


 6.24 	Mageblades are weapons that allow the wielder to channel their own spells 
through it 
 6.24.1 	When casting a spell using a weapon with the Mageblade ability, the 
weapon must be wielded, but no other free hand is required.

 6.24.2 	The spell can be channeled into the blade, charging it with an aura that 
delivers the spell's effect (instead of damage) on the next successful weapon hit.

 6.24.3 	Mageblade bows and crossbows deliver their spells by arrow or bolt, not 
by hitting with the weapon itself.

 6.24.4 	Only legal weapon hits will discharge the spell from a Mageblade weapon.

 6.24.5 	Immunity to the weapon's damage type will not prevent a Mageblade spell 
from discharging.

 6.24.6 	Any standard defense against spell effects or magic darts works as normal 
against Mageblade spells.

 6.24.7 	One must add the "Strike" descriptor when calling damage from a 
Mageblade weapon channeling a spell which deals damage.  (For example, you 
cast Slaying Swarm into a Mageblade weapon; you would call "4 Magic Slay 
Strike" for your next two legal hits. Note that the original spell create two darts 
and therefore allows the caster to hit twice with the spell’s ability.)

 6.24.8 	If no legal hit is landed within 1 minute of the spell being cast from a 
Mageblade weapon, the charge dissipates and is wasted.

 6.24.9 	Only spells that normally generate one or more tagbags are valid to be cast 
with Mageblade.

 6.24.10 	Any spell that generates more than one tagbag generates the same number 
of charges on the Mageblade weapon.

 6.24.11 	With a Mageblade weapon, only one charge is delivered with each legal 
hit, with each successive hit delivering another charge until they are all expended.

 6.25 	

 6.26 	A weapon imbued with any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd  level spell is considered Magic for no 
additional cost.

 6.27 	Master Blades are weapons of extreme quality only usable by Weapon Masters.

 6.27.1 	Masters Blades come with 16 craft points worth of extra attributes when 
they are created.

 6.27.2 	Master Blades are always counted as ‘Masterwork’.

 6.27.3 	Masters Blades provide an extra ‘Master Stroke’ slay or pierce call every 
game day to a single weapon master.

 6.27.4 	A Weapon Master cannot use this benefit from multiple Masters Blades

 6.27.5 	Masters Blades count as a weapon and a slotted item of its own type.

 6.27.6 	The prop for a Masters Blade must be of an above average cosmetic 
quality and must be approved by P&A

 6.28 	Staves of Wizardry are attuned to a single school of magic.

 6.28.1 	Staves of Wizardry will only function for a master of its school.

 6.28.2 	Staves of Wizardry lower the power cost for spells of levels 2-4 by 1 
power, but only for their specified school.

 6.28.3 	Staves of Wizardry count as both a weapon and a slotted item of its own 
type.

 6.28.4 	Staves of Wizardry cannot be enchanted with weapon spells or benefit 
from any weapon enhancement effects such as poisons.

 6.28.5 	Staves of Wizardry must be wielded to work, and provides no benefits 
when not carried in your hand(s).

 6.28.6 	To make a Staff of Wizardry, the crafter must be a Master Craftsman of 
both Weaponsmithing and Ornamenting.

 6.28.7 	Staves of Wizardry come with 16 craft points worth of extra abilities when 
they are created.

 6.29 	The player is responsible for providing their own props for Weaponsmtih crafted 
items.

 6.29.1 	Weapon props made created by a Weaponsmith must be items of quality.

 6.29.2 	Duct tape weapons are not allowed as Weaponsmith crafted items.

 6.29.3 	Weaponsmith crafted items made of exceptional materials must conform to 
the color requirements listed below:

*	Silver weapons must have white striking surfaces.
*	Goblin Iron weapons must have green striking surfaces.
*	Elven Steel weapons must have black with white veins on striking surfaces.
*	Magic weapons must have blue striking surfaces.
*	Nature weapons must have blue present on the item. (Nature weapons might 
be made of another material and must adhere to those color rules as well)

 6.29.4 	All created weapons must pass an inspection for quality and safety at 
Logistics.
 6.29.5 	If the weapon crafted by this skill passes the quality test in logistics, it will 
be marked with a number and entered into the treasure log.

 6.30 	Weapons created by a Weaponsmith are in-game, lootable items.

 6.30.1 	Players who loot a Weaponsmith crafted item from another player will be 
required to return the prop at the end of the weekend to the original owner and 
provide their own comparable prop. (This new prop must also pass Logistics 
inspection.)

 6.30.2 	Alternately, the new owner may buy the prop from the previous owner, 
using any combination of in-game coin or real-world dollars.

 6.30.3 	If a price or compromise cannot be reached, the in-game item is removed 
from play, the prop is returned to the original owner, and neither player can use it 
as an in-game item.

a bonus that cannot be dispelled and does not require an incant. (It is always active.)

 6.32.1 	The +1 armor bonus does not stack with the spell Enhance Armor and may 
not cause base armor value to exceed five points. This bonus applies to all 
physical armor worn.

 6.34 	Items which grant +1 or +2 bonuses to Magic Power points will not allow a player 
to use more than 20 Magic Power points in a single game day.


 6.35 	Nature Immunity counts towards the ‘only one immunity active at a time’ rule. 

 6.35.1 	A Nature Immunity item activates the first time it is worn during a game 
day.

 6.35.2 	If the item is ever removed, the ability deactivates and cannot work again 
until the following game day. (This means you cannot hand the item off to 
someone else to wear for them to utilize the effect.)

 6.35.3 	Nature Immunity items cannot be suppressed or dispelled.

 7 	Combat

 7.1 	Combat is very much a real life skill that requires practice on the part of the 
players.

 7.1.1 	While there are skills and abilities that can artificially boost the combat 
abilities of a player (Body points, armor, or weapon proficiencies) they will never 
compensate for a lack of skill.

 7.1.2 	There is no way for a player to officially remain out of combat or non-
combative during the course of the game. Simply participating in the game places 
a player at risk of getting caught up in combat and struck by weapons.

 7.1.3 	It is perfectly legal for players to ambush each other without prior warning, 
strike from behind, and use similar “first strike” tactics.

 7.1.4 	If a player feels in real life danger by participating in combat (medical 
condition, anxiety, etc.) they need to take steps to protect themselves while 
playing in the game. Protection might include always traveling with a group, 
wearing safety gear (kneepads, teeth guards), or simply practicing their powers of 
observation.

 7.1.5 	Players that have conditions that are easily aggravated by combat activities 
should never take skills that increase the time they will remain engaged in 
combat, such as Body points, and players with combat aggravated conditions are 
encouraged to communicate their concerns with the Game Masters and other 
players so that they can remain safe and still gain maximum enjoyment out of the 
game.

 7.1.6 	Respect all other players. Keep things friendly. After all, it’s a game and 
we’re all here to have fun.


 7.2 	The calls of a Combat & Safety Referee are ALWAYS right. Failure to follow the 
instructions of a referee will result in immediate expulsion from the event.

 7.2.1 	A Combat & Safety Referee has the right to inspect any weapon (including 
beanbags), shield, or piece of armor at any time, and remove them from play if 
they are damaged or otherwise unsafe.

 7.2.2 	A Combat & Safety Referee has the right to remove any player from the 
game they feel is mentally, emotionally, or physically incapable of playing safely. 
The player is free to protest their removal AFTER the game or immediate 
encounter is over, but in most cases the Game Master’s decision is upheld, since 
safety is paramount over opinion or hurt feelings.


 7.3 	Hit locations include Torso, Leg, Arm, Head and Neck, and Hands.

 7.3.1 	Torso: Includes shoulders, chest, stomach, sides, back, groin, and buttocks.

 7.3.2 	Aiming for the groin is forbidden, however accidental hits to the groin 
should be accepted as torso hits.

 7.3.3 	Leg: From the foot to the torso (below the buttocks).

 7.3.4 	Arm: From wrist to torso or shoulder socket.  A hit to the wrist counts as 
an arm hit.

 7.3.5 	Head and Neck: Off limits.

 7.3.6 	Feigning strikes at the head is not permitted.

 7.3.7 	Hands: Treated as part of the weapon if wielding a weapon (therefore 
unaffected). When not holding anything they are considered arms and should take 
hits as such.


 7.4 	A hit from a weapon counts if the striking surface of the weapon strikes the 
target’s body with noticeable force.

 7.4.1 	A legal strike is any hit that is clearly and distinctly felt on the receiver’s 
body.

 7.4.2 	Players may call “Light!” or “Too Fast!” to indicate to their attacker that 
they are not taking damage from the attacker’s hits, either from being hit too 
lightly or being hit too quickly. (This should not be abused in a manner to avoid 
taking hits. Not taking damage or effects from good hits is blatantly cheating.) 

 7.4.3 	Players wearing too much gear or armor to feel otherwise-legal hits must 
learn to spot hits by hearing or sight.


 7.4.4 	Players who demonstrate an inability to do so will be required to remove 
their armor or gear until they have more practice taking their hits.

 7.4.5 	Combat is full-speed, but not full-force. Players must not strike any blow 
that uses their full force.

 7.4.6 	The rule of thumb when striking someone is to strike an opponent with as 
much force as is needed to make them acknowledge the blow, and never more.

 7.4.7 	Hits from arrows, crossbow bolts, javelins or throwing spears only count if 
the target is struck with the head of the projectile.

 7.4.8 	Hits from throwing weapons count if the target is struck with any part of 
the projectile.

 7.4.9 	A player who has fallen to the ground from a wound should never be hit. If 
the fallen must be dispatched, only a Killing Blow is required.

 7.4.10 	Players are required to call out the type and amount of damage they are 
doing with each hit.

 7.4.11 	In the lack of a damage call, the player taking the hit should simply accept 
one normal damage – do not ignore the hit.

 7.4.12 	Players may deliberately “down-call” their damage to an amount lower 
than they normally hit for.

 7.4.13 	Players may down-call their damage types if desired for clarity, or if 
required as part of a scenario.

 7.4.14 	Players are required to call “No Effect!” when, for any reason, a normally 
good hit causes no damage.

 7.4.15 	Players taking no damage because the hit struck an illegal location (head, 
weapon hand, etc.) should also indicate this to their attacker.


 7.5 	Shields are defined as any rigid defensive item held in the hand or on the arm, 
padded on all edges to prevent damage to weapons and minimize accidental damage 
to players.

 7.5.1 	Any rule or reference applying to shields also applies to bucklers, unless 
specifically superseded or overridden here.

 7.5.2 	All shields shall have a distinct, rigid core, including but not limited to 
steel, aluminum, plywood or rigid plastics.
 7.5.3 	All plastic, foam or other modern materials shall be covered with paint, 
cloth or leather. Exposed aluminum, titanium, galvanized steel, or other modern 
metals are acceptable.

 7.5.4 	Shields that exhibit more than minor (approximately 10 degrees of) flex 
shall be disallowed.

 7.5.5 	Shields shall have no exposed non-rounded metal hardware, such as bolts 
or screws.

 7.5.6 	Minimum padding on all edges of a shield shall be five-eighths inch of 
closed-cell foam.

 7.5.6.1 	If the shield edge is covered by rubber, vinyl, or similar flexible 
tubing or hose underneath the padding, the minimum padding may be three-
eighths inch of closed cell foam.

 7.5.7 	Any shield is destroyed after taking 4 points of Acid damage. 

 7.5.7.1 	This damage is cumulative over the course of an event, but resets 
between events.

 7.5.7.2 	This damage can be repaired at any time by targeting the shield 
with a Mend Armor spell.

 7.5.7.3 	The shield cannot be held or used while damage is repaired. It 
should be laid flat on the ground or leaned against an inanimate object such as 
a tree or building.

 7.5.7.4 	Destroyed shields should be dropped.

 7.5.7.5 	Hits to a destroyed shield that is not dropped go directly to the 
Torso, ignoring armor and magical protections (but not Body points).


 7.5.8 	The size of a rectangular shield shall be determined by measuring the 
height and width, and multiplying.

 7.5.8.1 	All shields that are not round are rectangular.

 7.5.8.2 	No allowance shall be made for irregularities, cut-outs, or curves.

 7.5.8.3 	A rectangular shield may not exceed 40 inches in any one 
dimension.

 7.5.8.4 	A rectangular shield may not exceed 720 square inches in surface 
area.

 7.5.8.5 	A round shield may not exceed a 36 inch diameter.

 7.5.8.6 	A rectangular buckler may not exceed 24 inches in any one 
dimension.

 7.5.8.7 	A rectangular buckler may not exceed 324 square inches in surface 
area.

 7.5.8.8 	A round buckler may not exceed a 24 inch diameter.

 7.5.8.9 	The minimum dimension in any direction for any shield is twelve 
inches.

 7.5.8.10 	Curved shields shall be measured across the face of the shield 
(across the arc, not the chord).

 7.5.9 	Passive shields are not allowed.

 7.5.9.1 	Passive shields are shields that are not held in a player’s hand.

 7.5.9.2 	Bucklers are specifically excepted from this rule, and may be 
strapped to a player’s arm to leave the hand free.

 7.5.10 	A player may only use one shield at a time.


 7.6 	Turtling is when a player with a shield exposes only their head, and no legal target 
areas in their front 90 degree arc.

 7.6.1 	Turtling is not permitted.

 7.6.2 	If a Combat & Safety Referee determines you are turtling, either due to 
deliberate crouching or simply small body size, you will be required to discard 
your shield until you can procure a smaller shield less likely to cause you to fight 
illegally.


 7.7 	Shields are solely defensive items. No shield rushing or checking is allowed. At 
no time should your shield come into contact with anything except the weapons of 
another player.

 7.8 	All weapons are subject to inspection and/or rejection at any time and for any 
reason by Combat & Safety Referees.

 7.8.1 	Rejected weapons found in play may be summarily destroyed.

 7.8.2 	All striking surfaces should have a minimum of 5/8 inch of closed-cell 
foam.

of closed-cell foam.

 7.8.4 	All pommels must be composed of a flexible material.

 7.8.5 	All crossguards, quillions, basket hilts, or other hilt fittings (not to include 
the grip itself) must be composed of a flexible material.

 7.8.6 	All melee weapons must have a rigid core.

 7.8.7 	Weapons that flex more than 45 degrees will be rejected.

 7.8.8 	Cores of wood or metal are forbidden. Acceptable core materials include 
but are not limited to: plastic, PVC, fiberglass, and carbon fiber.

 7.8.9 	The minimum length for any melee weapon is 16 inches.

 7.8.10 	No swung weapon may have more than 1/3 of its length unpadded for 
striking.

 7.8.11 	No swung weapon may have more than 30 unpadded inches.

 7.8.12 	Illegal weapons include, but are not limited to: flails, punch daggers, 
slings, ball and chain weapons, and blowguns. Any weapon with a flexible 
component is forbidden. Any weapon which strikes primarily with a punching 
motion of the arm rather than a swinging motion is forbidden (katar, tonfa). Any 
weapon designed primarily to entangle rather than damage (whips, nets, bolas) is 
forbidden.

 7.8.13 	Non-handle pommels shall not count towards the overall length 
measurement of a weapon.

 7.8.14 	The core of the weapons should be securely held within the padding by 
glue, tape, or some other adhesive.

 7.8.15 	Weapons with padding that slides or twists on the core will be rejected.

 7.8.16 	Weapons with cores that rattle or bounce within the padding will be 
rejected.

total.

 7.14.2 	Throwing spears may weigh no more than 24 ounces.

Players are encouraged to incorporate some open-cell foam into the ends of their

 7.15 	Thrown weapons, javelins and throwing spears may be blocked or deflected by 
shields or weapons.

 7.15.1 	Thrown weapon users (not javelins or throwing spears) may call their hits 
on others for clarity. Players that abuse this rule will not be allowed to use 
throwing weapons.


 7.16 	You may not ever carry another player's thrown weapons around without their 
express permission. You may return fire with thrown weapons that have been thrown

 7.17.6 	Crossbows may not fire at targets within 10 feet unless their draw is tested 
at 15 pounds or less.

 7.17.7 	Arrows must always be fired from a bow, they may never be used as melee 
or thrown weapons.

 7.17.8 	If an arrow strikes a weapon, the arrow shall be called as if the weapon 
was not there and the arrow continued through unimpeded.

 7.17.9 	Only shields can block arrows.

 7.17.10 	A player who intentionally blocks or deflects an arrow with a weapon, 
hand, head or foot takes that hit directly to the Torso, ignoring armor and magical 
protections (but not Body points).

 7.17.11 	If an arrow strikes a Wounded limb, the hit goes to the Torso instead.

 7.17.12 	Once an arrow has hit any object (changed its path) it is harmless. An 
arrow cannot strike multiple targets. 

 7.17.13 	You may not ever carry another player's arrows around without their 
express permission. You may return fire with arrows that have been shot at you, 
but if you leave the immediate area where the arrows were fired, you may not take 
any arrows other than your own with you.

 7.17.14 	Any player entering play with a bow must also enter play with three legal, 
usable arrows.

 7.17.15 	Bows may not be used to block or parry strikes or thrusts. A bow that is 
struck in melee combat is destroyed.

 7.17.16 	This damage can be repaired at any time by targeting the bow with a Mend 
Armor spell.

 7.17.17 	The bow cannot be held or used while damage is repaired. It should be laid 
flat on the ground or leaned against an inanimate object such as a tree or building.

 7.17.18 	Hits to a destroyed bow that is not dropped go directly to the Torso, 
ignoring armor and magical protections (but not Body points).


 7.18 	Arrows and Bolts are the ammunition for Bows and Crossbows

 7.18.1 	A draw stop shall be present on all arrows to ensure they are not drawn 
past 28 inches.

 7.18.2 	The head of an arrow shall not be smaller in any dimension than 2 inches.

 7.18.3 	The heads of all arrows shall be of a uniform, round shape.

 7.18.4 	All arrows shall contain a coin or other small rigid disk perpendicular to 
the end of the shaft to prevent shaft punch-through.

 7.18.5 	Commercially-made rubber bird blunts also fulfill this requirement

 7.18.6 	Golf tube arrows are not permitted.

 7.18.7 	All arrows and bolts must have at least two full fletchings and a nock.

 7.18.8 	The head of an arrow or bolt must not be wobbly or move from side to 
side.

 7.18.9 	Archers may call their hits on others for clarity. Players that abuse this rule 
will not be allowed to use missile weapons.


 7.19 	At no time should a player carry real weapons of any sort.  This includes walking 
sticks, canes, and torches.

 7.19.1 	Players who need mobility assisting devices like canes should consult a 
Combat & Safety Referee on what to do during play.


 7.20 	Physical contact between players should never take place. All combat at 
Kingdoms of Novitas is carried out with foam weapons.

 7.20.1 	A player is not permitted to move toward another player in such a manner 
that the second player must move to avoid physical contact.

 7.20.2 	Players may not grapple, wrestle, or otherwise entrap limbs or impair 
movement during combat.

 7.20.3 	It is acceptable to use an axe, halberd, or other weapon to pull a shield or 
limb.

 7.20.4 	It is acceptable to grasp another player’s weapon, provided you do not do 
so by a striking surface. Grasping another player’s weapon by a striking surface 
will result in damage.


 7.21 	Players are allowed to inflict non-lethal damage, called Blunt damage.

 7.21.1 	Blunt damage can only be inflicted with melee weapons. Spells, missile 
weapons (including thrown weapons), and thrown poisons are incapable of 
inflicting blunt damage.

 7.21.2 	The damage call for Blunt damage is “Blunt!”
 7.21.3 	Blunt damage affects a target’s defenses in the same manner as normal 
damage so it is still required to beat through a target’s armor and so forth.

 7.21.4 	All Body points and Wounds lost to Blunt damage recover after ten 
minutes if not healed normally.

 7.21.5 	Armor and/or magical defenses destroyed or expended by blunt damage 
does not recover and must be repaired through normal means.


 7.22 	The Heroic Safety Rule: it is not required that a player count self-inflicted damage 
such as dropping weapons on their feet, smacking their own leg with a weapon due to 
a very bad swing, and so on.

 7.22.1 	Heroic Safety does not protect against “friendly fire”.


 7.23 	Players remove defenses in the following order: magical defenses, magical armor, 
physical armor, damage requirement, Body points, Wounds.

 7.23.1 	The call “Pierce” ignores magical and physical armor.

 7.23.2 	Magical armor covers the entire body with no gaps in coverage

 7.23.3 	Physical armor only protects the areas it actually covers.

 7.23.4 	An area that has at least 75% coverage is considered to be completely 
covered.

 7.23.5 	The physical armor granted by a helmet is always deducted first.

 7.23.6 	Loss of armor is not locational. If, for example, the armor on your leg is 
destroyed, all your armor is destroyed.

 7.23.7 	Physical armor automatically recovers between events.

 7.23.8 	Body points are not locational. If, for example, you lose a Body point from 
being struck on the arm, that Body point is also gone from all other areas.

 7.23.9 	Body Points and limb wounds recover automatically between events.

 7.23.10 	When a player has no further Body points, subsequent hits will cause a 
Wound on the location struck.

 7.23.11 	If a hit inflicts so much damage that it reduces a character's Body points to 
a negative value in a single shot, a wound is automatically caused in the area 
struck.

 7.23.12 	Wounds to a limb render the limb useless.

 7.23.13 	Anything carried in the hand of a Wounded arm must be dropped.

 7.23.14 	A Wounded leg must be dragged and cannot bear any weight.

 7.23.15 	Hopping on one leg is not permitted.

 7.23.16 	A player with two Wounded legs must remain on his knees and is 
immobile, but may turn to face any direction.

 7.23.17 	Wounds to the torso render the character in a helpless state of near 
unconsciousness and a great deal of pain. Characters with torso Wounds must fall 
to the ground. They may not move, can take no actions, and cannot use any non-
automatic skills. Characters with torso Wounds are allowed to feebly cry out for 
help in a last desperate attempt to save their life, and may speak, albeit haltingly, 
to other players.

 7.23.18 	Characters that receive a torso Wound have ten minutes to get healing or 
they will die.

 7.23.19 	Torso Wounds do not heal between events.


 7.24 	Killing blows are used to dispatch characters that are incapacitated or near death, 
representing a throat slit or some similar instantly lethal coup de gras. Once the 
attacker announces a killing blow, the victim instantly dies regardless of Body points 
or Wound status.

 7.24.1 	A player may killing blow a character that is suffering from a torso Wound, 
bound, faking death, or unconscious.

 7.24.2 	It is impossible to killing blow a character under the influence of Charm, 
Pin, Fear, or Stun. A killing blow ignores all forms of protection the character may 
have, including magical and physical armor.

 7.24.3 	To deliver one, the attacker must place a weapon on the victim's chest and 
loudly announce “KILLING BLOW!”

 7.24.4 	Players will sometimes simply act out a Killing Blow. The absence of a 
call of “Killing Blow!” shall not invalidate an obvious, theatrical coup de gras. 
This practice is encouraged.

 7.24.5 	A weapon is required to deliver a killing blow, so an unarmed character is 
incapable of giving a killing blow.

 7.24.6 	Tag bags can be used to deliver a killing blow.

 7.24.7 	Only the torso is a legal spot for a killing blow; it is impossible to deliver 
one through a character’s limb.

 7.24.8 	Creatures with Damage Requirements require a weapon that would 
normally affect them to give the killing blow.


 7.25 	Armor must never impede the normal movement of a player’s body in a fashion 
that endangers the wearer or prevents the player from following the rules of the game, 
e.g. If a player is wearing armor that prevents them from kneeling, they are unable to 
properly accept leg wounds.

 7.25.1 	Armor must be attached or fitted on the body with proper integral closures 
such as buckles, laces, or snaps. Players are not allowed to attach armor to their 
body with tape, string, or similar temporary means.

 7.25.2 	Armors constructed in a markedly ineffective manner, that would provide 
little actual protection, or damaged armors, may have their value downgraded.

 7.25.3 	Wearing armor does not count as a costume and players are required to 
wear a proper costume under their armor at all times.

 7.25.4 	This includes racial make-up, EVEN if the player is wearing a full-face 
helmet.

 7.25.5 	Players wearing plate armor are required to wear a padded gambeson or 
arming jack underneath the armor.

 7.25.6 	Armor that consistently causes unreasonable damage to weapons will be 
removed from play.


 7.26 	Metal armor plates are of at least inch thickness.

 7.26.1 	All edges of metal plates should be safely blunted or rolled.

 7.26.2 	Chain mail rings should be of no greater than one-half inch inside 
diameter.

 7.26.3 	Metal scales must be of at least inch thickness

 7.26.4 	Metal scales must overlap to provide armor value.


 7.26.5 	Metal brigandine is armor constructed of non-overlapping metal plates on 
a backing material.

 7.26.6 	Brigandine plates must be within one-half inch of each other.

 7.26.7 	Brigandine plates must have multiple points of attachment to the backing 
or to each other, or be held in individual pockets.

 7.26.8 	Non-leather backing materials generally reduce the armor value of 
brigandine armor as per rule.

 7.26.9 	The plates may be inside or outside the backing material.


 7.27 	Leather armor must be constructed of real leather of any thickness (unless 
otherwise specified). No pleather, vinyl, or other synthetic leathers are acceptable.

 7.27.1 	Studded leathers may be studded with metal spots, rings, washers or rivets. 
No bottle caps, brads or plastic may be used.

 7.27.2 	Studded leather should have no more than 1 inch of un-studded leather on 
any part of it.

 7.27.3 	The simple test used for this will be to try and place a US quarter dollar 
coin between studs. It should fit with a small bit of wiggle room, but no more.

 7.27.4 	Leather scales must overlap to provide armor value.

 7.27.5 	Light leather is leather of at least 6 ounce weight (3/32 inch).

 7.27.6 	Heavy leather is leather of at least 12 ounce weight (3/16 inch).

 7.27.7 	Leather is a natural material with natural variations that may result in 
irregular measurements. Players are free to request an average of multiple (up to 
five) measurements when their armor is measured for its armor point value.

 7.27.8 	No layering of leather is permitted in any area being measured for armor 
point value.

 7.27.9 	Leather brigandine is armor constructed of non-overlapping leather plates 
on a backing material.

 7.27.10 	Brigandine plates must be within one-half inch of each other.

 7.27.11 	Brigandine plates must have multiple points of attachment to the backing 
or to each other, or be held in individual pockets.

 7.27.12 	Non-leather backing materials do not contribute to the armor value of 
brigandine armor.

 7.27.13 	Brigandine plates must equal or exceed the value of the backing leather to 
be counted as armor.

 7.27.14 	The plates may be inside or outside the backing material.


 7.28 	Armor made of non-period materials (plastics, kydex, nylon, etc.) is not allowed.

 7.28.1 	Non-period metals or alloys, such as aluminum, titanium, galvanized steel, 
stainless steel, nickel-plated steel, or anodized aluminum are allowed.

 7.29 	Armor counts for between 1 and 4 points of protection.

 7.29.1 	Only areas that are actually covered by armor gain the protection from it.


 7.30 	Monstrous armor takes only one damage from sources without the Slay ability.

 7.30.1 	The Monstrous ability is only granted to areas covered with 3 point or 4 
point armors, not to areas covered by lesser armors being counted as a greater 
points value to match torso armor.

 7.30.2 	In order for any limb armor worn to be counted as Monstrous, Monstrous 
torso armor must also be worn.


 7.31 	Combining or layering armor does not give a player more than one armor point 
value, nor does it increase the value of the armor on a location..

 7.31.1 	The character still has a single, main armor value that is based on the best 
armor they are wearing on their torso.

 7.31.2 	To wear other armor, such as legs and arms, and have it count as coverage, 
that armor must be no more than one point lower than the player’s torso armor 
value.

 7.31.3 	Limb armor may be of a higher point value than the torso armor

 7.31.4 	In this case, the limb armor uses the lower armor point value of the torso 
armor.

 7.31.5 	Players may count their torso armor as lower than its listed value to get 
limb armor to count. This rule also applies to helmets.


 7.32 	Helmets grant 1 point of universal armor.

 7.32.1 	Universal armor covers all hit locations.

 7.33 	Light helmets are helmets that cover at least the entire crown of the head, but have 
minimal or no neck and face coverage.

 7.33.1 	Light helmets must be constructed primarily of metal.

 7.34 	Heavy helmets are light helmets that also cover the face and neck.

 7.34.1 	Heavy helmets must be constructed of at least light leather.

 7.35 	The following offer One point of armor:
 
*	Full Costume
*	Studded Leather
*	Light Leather
*	Furs
*	Helmet Only
*	Brigandine (Light Leather backing with Light plates)


 7.35.1 	Full Costume: A player dressed in a full, appropriate fantasy or historical 
costume, free of anachronisms, from head to toe, is granted one point of complete 
armor coverage. This allowance may not be combined with a helmet or other 
armor. Players who wish to claim this point of armor must present themselves in 
full garb to Logistics to be inspected.

 7.35.2 	Furs: Real animal hides with the fur on, unless the leather is thick enough 
to qualify as a higher value by itself.


 7.36 	The following offer Two points of armor:

*	Studded Light Leather
*	Heavy Leather
*	Scale Armor / Lamellar (Overlapping light leather pieces)
*	Any 1 Point Armor with a Helmet

*	Metal Scale or Lamellar Armor
*	Brigandine (Heavy Leather backing with heavy leather plates)
*	Brigandine (Any backing with metal plates)
*	Half-Plate (Metal armor, no articulated joints, up to 25% chain/leather)

 7.37.1 	Half-plate is metal plate armor that does not incorporate any articulated 
joints and/or has up to 25% exposed leather or chain.

 7.37.1.1 	Lorica Segmentata is half-plate armor.

 7.37.1.2 	A 2-piece back-and-breast is half-plate armor.

 7.37.1.3 	Half-plate armor counts as Monstrous.


 7.38 	The following offer Four points of armor:

*	Any 3 Point Armor with a Helmet
*	Articulated Plate Armor (See below)

 7.38.1 	Articulated plate armor: Plate armor with flexible joints that can bend and 
move with the movements of the player while still providing complete coverage.

 7.38.2 	Articulated armor must be a complete harness, e.g. articulated arms would 
contain a full vambrace, articulated elbow, rerebrace, and pauldrons.

 7.38.3 	Wearing incomplete articulated plate, e.g. wearing a back-and-breast 
without fauld, tassets and gorget, makes it half plate armor.

 7.38.4 	Articulated plate armor is Monstrous.


 7.39 	The following offer Five points of armor:

*	Any four point armor with a helmet.

 9 	Traps
 9.1 	Traps come in three categories: Single step mechanisms, contraptions, and zero-
level traps.
 9.1.1 	A single step mechanism has a single tripwire, button, lever, or other 
mechanism that must be bypassed to disarm a trap.
 9.1.2 	A trap with a single step mechanism must include a noisemaker.
 9.1.3 	A trap with a single step mechanism must include a valid Trap Tag, a GM 
written tag, or otherwise be clearly labeled with the trap’s effect.
 9.1.4 	Only one tag or effect is allowed for each independent single step 
mechanism.
 9.1.5 	Once a single step mechanism trap is discharged its trap tag is considered 
consumed and should be destroyed.
 9.1.6 	The responsibility to place the tag belongs to the player setting the trap, 
not to the Game Masters or Logistics officials.
 9.1.7 	Any single step mechanism without a valid label will be assumed to be an 
Alarm Trap.
 9.1.8 	Players must make an honest effort find the label before assuming that any 
trap is an Alarm Trap.
 9.1.9 	In no event should it take longer than 30 seconds of honest search to locate 
a label.
 9.1.10 	A game hold may be called while conducting a quick search for a label.
 9.1.11 	Only a someone with the Tinkerer skill may set or disarm a trap.
 9.1.12 	Unskilled players automatically trigger the trap when attempting to set or 
disarm a trap themselves.
 9.1.13 	Unskilled players may assist only in a non-technical manner such as 
holding a light
 9.1.14 	A player who sets off a trap receives the effect of trap’s label.
 9.1.15 	Any player discharging a trap is assumed to have been struck in the torso 
by the label’s effect.
 9.1.16 	In no way can a discharging player claim that they are an invalid target of 
the trap’s effect; no amount of rationalization will avoid these effects.
 9.1.17 	Normal defenses and magical protections still apply for players that 
discharge a trap.
 9.1.18 	Traps may not be damaged or destroyed while being disarmed.
 9.1.19 	At no time may a player break or cut any component of an in-play trap.
 9.1.20 	Valid methods of disarming a trap may include but are not limited to: 
removing the battery, wedging or jamming a lever or switch, spanning a gap 
between electrical conducts with a conductive material, or cutting a tripwire.
 9.1.21 	Cutting a tripwire is a specific exception to the trap destruction rule.
 9.1.22 	All player created traps must be submitted to logistics for approval.
 9.1.23 	All traps submitted to logistics must be constructed in such a way that they 
may be disarmed with standard Novitas-style tools.
 9.1.24 	It is the responsibility of the player to prove that a trap meets this 
qualification.
 9.1.25 	Traps that meet logistics approval will be assigned a number as per the 
item creation rules.
 9.1.26 	The Heroic Safety Rule does not apply to traps.
 9.1.26.1 	Discharging a trap while attempting to set, disarm, move, or 
transport a trap results in you receiving the effect of the trap normally 
including the expenditure of the trap tag.
 9.1.27 	A Tinkerer may only arm a trap with an approved trap tag.
 9.1.27.1 	Trap tags are loot-able.
 9.1.28 	All single step mechanism traps with item numbers are loot-able.
 9.1.29 	All single step mechanism traps without item numbers are not loot-able.
 9.1.30 	The three types of single step mechanism trap are Alarm Traps, Magic 
Traps, and Alchemical Traps.
 9.1.30.1 	An Alarm Trap is a single step mechanism that does nothing when 
triggered but make a noise.
 9.1.30.2 	Alarm Traps never cause damage.
 9.1.30.3 	Alarm Traps can be freely re-armed by a Tinkerer after they go off.
 9.1.31 	A Magic Trap is a single step mechanism that has been charged with 
magical energy.
 9.1.31.1 	The generic form of the Magic Trap deals 4 Magic damage to the 
torso.
 9.1.31.2 	Magic Traps may be set with other effects of the Magic type.
 9.1.31.3 	Magic Traps may only be armed with Magic Trap Tags.
 9.1.31.4 	A Tinkerer does not need to know a Trap’s spell to arm it; they only 
need to have a valid matching Trap Tag to use.
 9.1.32 	An Alchemical Trap is a single step mechanism that has been loaded with 
an alchemical compound or amalgam.
 9.1.32.1 	The generic form of the Alchemical Trap deals 4 Poison damage to 
the torso.
 9.1.32.2 	Alchemical Traps may be set with other effects of the Alchemy 
type.
 9.1.32.3 	Alchemical Traps may only be armed with Alchemical Trap Tags.
 9.1.32.4 	A Tinkerer does not need to know a Trap’s Alchemical effect to arm 
it; they only need to have a valid matching Trap Tag to use. 

 9.2 	Contraptions are special items which allow a player to carry a specially modified 
single step mechanism with them.
 9.2.1 	Contraptions take up the Accessory slot when determining slots for 
Ornamented Items.
 9.2.2 	Contraptions act as single step mechanism traps in all ways but the 
following exceptions:
 9.2.3 	Contraptions are meant to be mobile and are not required to attached to 
anything immovable.
 9.2.4 	Contraptions may only carry beneficial alchemical and spell effects.
 9.2.5 	Contraptions must have their entire single step mechanism enclosed within 
a logistics approved box or other container.
 9.2.6 	The box or container must not fall below a minimum of 4 cubic inches in 
size. An example would be a container that is effectively 2”x2”x1”, or the size of 
a large ring box.
 9.2.7 	The box or container may have no dimension of less than 1”. 

 9.3 	Zero Level Traps are simple hazards that can be avoided by any players even if 
they do not have the skill Tinkerer.
 9.3.1 	Zero-Level Traps are Game Master created traps.
 9.3.2 	Examples of zero level traps could include open pits (see below) or 
buckets of acid (water, confetti) propped over a half open door.
 9.3.3 	Players may avoid these hazards with common sense. Examples may 
include placing a board over the pit, or removing the bucket from the door.
 9.3.4 	A Game Master should be consulted if players are unsure if a trap is zero 
level or not.
 9.3.5 	Pit traps are zero level traps.
 9.3.6 	Open pit traps are represented in game by black plastic sheets or tarps.
 9.3.7 	Players who see any such obstacle should inquire to a Game Master as to 
its nature.
 9.3.8 	At times, tarps may be used for mundane reasons, such as the walls of a 
tunnel, and may be mistaken for pits, so it is always better to be safe than sorry.
 9.3.9 	If at any time, the player touches the plastic representing the pit with any 
part of their body, they fall in.
 9.3.10 	Pits may inflict damage from the fall and also from secondary sources such 
as spikes, or may simply trap a character until rescued.
 9.3.11 	This can cause any number of points of damage, or even deliver poison or 
magic attacks.
 9.3.12 	Pits can also kill instantly with no recourse.
 9.3.13 	Players who fall into pits and don’t die will be stuck there unless the Game 
Master allows them to climb out. Often this is roleplayed by another player 
lowering a rope and hauling them out.

 10.1.11 	Any weapon that does not pass safety inspection will be removed from 
play and the player will lose the treasure.

Logistics or a GM.
 10.2.9 	In game, the coins are made of the metal described by their value and 
players should treat them as such when role-playing.
 10.2.10 	Out of game, players should be wary of any coin that appears to be 
counterfeit.
 10.2.11 	Trying to pass off counterfeit coins is cheating.
 10.2.12 	If a counterfeit coin is encountered, do not accept the coin and report the 
player to a Game Master.
 10.2.13 	Players caught carrying counterfeit money will be removed from the game 
for cheating.
 10.2.14 	A coin is still worth its full value if it is a least 75% intact.

be replaced. 

 10.3 	Small plastic gemstones represent in-game gems.
 10.3.1 	All gemstones are inscribed with a number allowing for their identification 
and authentication.
 10.3.2 	The skill Estimate Value is required to identify their value.

to a GM.
 10.3.5 	Gemstones may be used as ritual components. 

 10.4 	Valuable objects can include works of art, fine tapestries, or rare works of 
literature.
 10.4.1 	All valuable objects are inscribed with a number allowing for their 
identification and authentication.
 10.4.2 	The skill Estimate Value is required to identify the value of valuable 
objects.
 10.4.3 	A valuable object may possess other properties at the same time. For 
example, it is possible to have a silver short sword that is so ornately carved it is 
also worth a great deal of money. 

 10.5 	Magic objects are objects which have been endowed with magical properties in 
play.
 10.5.1 	Magic objects come in almost any shape and size from rings to weapons.
 10.5.2 	All magic objects in play are considered to give off obvious magical signs 
such as a dull warmth or a light blue glow that can be perceived by any player 
who touches them.
 10.5.3 	These signs do not allow a character to identify the exact properties of the 
object, only that it is magical.
 10.5.4 	Players may not hide the fact that an object is magical.
 10.5.5 	All magic objects are inscribed with a number allowing for their 
identification and authentication.
 10.5.6 	The skill Identify Magic is required to identify their specific properties and

allowing the weapon to be identified as magical from a distance in addition to 
their treasure ID number,.
 10.5.11 	It is only required that the blade or striking surface of the weapon be 
colored with blue, so players may decorate the handle and cross guards as normal.
 10.5.12 	In play magic objects are considered indestructible and never show signs 
of tarnish or age.
 10.5.13 	Magic objects can never be perverted from their original function despite 
any logic offered.
 10.5.14 	Examples include: a magic dagger cannot be taped to a pole to make a 
silver spear; a ring of spell storing cannot be taped to an arrow to make the arrow 
magical; a Wraith cannot be beaten to death with a Tome of Magic.
 10.5.15 	A GM that observes a player abusing a magic object the object will be 
removed from play. 

 10.6 	There are four types of magic object: temporary, permanent-per-game-day, 
permanent, and enchantments.
 10.6.1 	Temporary, or charged, objects have only a few uses.
 10.6.1.1 	Once the charges have been expended the object is useless.
 10.6.1.2 	Temporary objects can never be recharged.
 10.6.1.3 	The player is on their honor to keep track of the object's uses.
 10.6.1.4 	If a Game Master feels the object is being abused they will remove 
it from play.
 10.6.1.5 	All temporary items require an incant to activate their abilities, just 
as if casting a spell, unless specifically excepted from this requirement.
 10.6.2 	Permanent-per-game-day objects have limited charges per game day.
 10.6.2.1 	A player may only channel twenty spell levels worth of spells from 
permanent-per-game-day objects each game day.
 10.6.2.2 	Once the object's charges have been expended it is useless until the 
next game day.
 10.6.2.3 	At the beginning of the next game day the object returns to its full 
charge.
 10.6.2.4 	The player is on their honor to keep track of the object's uses per 
day.

it from play.

the item for the first time.

game.

current characters (their in-game lifespan).

but this must be done in-game and in-character.
 10.7.8 	Once a feast item is given away like this, it loses all special properties as

lose it's magical properties in-game).
 10.7.9 	February Feast item properties are only applicable to the person who paid 
for the item at the fundraiser. 

 10.8 	Weapons crafted from special materials do not need to be identified in order to 
access their damage requirement as their properties are readily apparent.
 10.8.1 	Each special material weapon in game has a treasure ID number for 
reasons of authentication.
 10.8.2 	In order to access any additional abilities of a numbered weapon it must 
first be identified using the ID Magic skill.
 10.8.3 	If players encounter a special material weapon with no number it is not a 
legal weapon
 10.8.4 	The blade or striking surface of all Elven Steel weapons must be covered 
with black paint decorated with lightning-like lines of white crisscrossing its 
surface.
 10.8.4.1 	Elven Steel weapons posses the damage requirement properties of 
both a magic weapon and a silver weapon allowing the weapon to hurt

 11 	Crime & Punishment
 11.1 	Crime - When cheating occurs, violators are quickly discovered and dealt with.  
Kingdoms of Novitas strives for a playing environment relatively free of cheating. 
While it is necessary to discuss the topic, few of these disciplinary actions have ever 
been enforced.
 11.1.1 	Players who suspect someone of cheating should privately take their 
concerns to a Game Master. Players should never confront each other directly, 
instead let a Game Master decide what action to take. 

 11.2 	Ignorance is no excuse for cheating and players are expected to learn all the rules 
of the game and follow them. 

 11.3 	The following are actions that are viewed as cheating: Disregard for the Rules, 
Disregard for Safety, Disruption of Atmosphere, Disrespect for Authority, Disrespect 
for Players, Loop-holing, Meta-gaming, New Player Predation, Abuse of Property
 11.3.1 	Players will often ignore the rules of the game. Hitting for more damage, 
drinking alcohol on site, or not expending uses of magic objects are all examples 
of disregard for the rules.
 11.3.2 	Safety should be the foremost concern of all players. Swinging with too 
much force would be an example of disregard for safety. The game will no longer 
be fun if people are getting hurt.
 11.3.3 	Players who disrupt the atmosphere ruin the game for everyone. Walking 
around out of costume, driving cars through the game site, or playing radios are 
examples of disruption.
 11.3.3.1 	“Playing possum”, which is playing dead when your character is 
not, and then popping up to rejoin the action at a more opportune time, is 
another example of this. Were LARP combat real, you would be able to see 
the state of people's injuries at a glance. When we're all pretending, you can't 
see the difference. This is why playing dead is cheating.
 11.3.4 	Players that refuse to follow or argue the orders of a Game Master or other 
officials cannot play the game properly and ruin it for others.
 11.3.5 	Players should treat other in a civil manner. Players should not be rude, 
offensive, or violent towards other players.
 11.3.6 	Loop-holing is using gaps or holes in the wording of the rules, contrary to 
the spirit of the rules, in order to gain an advantage in play.
 11.3.6.1 	If you find what you think is a loop-hole in the rules, please bring it 
to the attention of a Game Master so the problem can be fixed.
 11.3.7 	Use of out-of-game information or abilities for the benefit of a character. 
For example, as a non-player-character a player watches to see which player gets 
the treasure on a module. Later, acting as their player character they kill that 
character and take the treasure.
 11.3.8 	Experienced players who take advantage of new players due to their lack 
of out-of-game knowledge of the rules. Telling a first time player incorrect values 
for coins, or abusing a player’s inexperience in any other manner, is frowned 
upon.
 11.3.9 	Players who abuse the property of Kingdoms of Novitas or facilities being 
used by Kingdoms of  Novitas are cheating. This could include littering, breaking 
windows, destroying props, and similar acts of vandalism.
 11.3.10 	These are only examples of in-game offenses, and players are still bound 
by all state and federal laws of the area the game is held.
 11.3.11 	Players who are accused or caught breaking such laws will be handed over 
and dealt with by the appropriate authorities. 

 11.4 	Punishment - Players who are discovered violating in-game rules can expect the 
following disciplinary actions.
 11.4.1 	In-game penalties are the quickest form of punishment. Any Game Master 
can enforce an in-game penalty at any time. An in-game penalty affects a player's 
character and not a player themselves. For example, a character refusing to take 
hits could be given a torso wound. In-game penalties are usually for people who 
cheated unintentionally, first time offenders, or new players.
 11.4.2 	Out-of-game penalties affect a player directly. Any Game Master can 
enforce an out-of-game penalty at any time. Out-of-game penalties could include 
loss of fighting privileges or being required to sit out of the game for an amount 
of time. Out-of-game penalties are usually for people intentionally cheating, or 
repeat offenders.
 11.4.3 	In extreme cases, players can be suspended from the game. While 
suspended, the player may not attend Kingdoms of Novitas events.  Suspensions 
are best reserved for habitual offenders.
 11.4.3.1 	Suspended players may attend public demos, but only as spectators.
 11.4.3.2 	Suspension can last from one to three full events.
 11.4.3.3 	Site fees and/or donations will not be refunded to a player if they 
are suspended.
 11.4.3.4 	A panel of three Game Masters most vote unanimously to enforce a 
suspension.
 11.4.4 	Expulsion permanently removes a player's privileges to participate at 
Kingdoms of Novitas.  Expulsion is reserved for players who have become 
physically violent towards another player or a Game Master, has been suspended 
multiple times, or committed a real world crime while at Kingdoms of Novitas.
 11.4.4.1 	Expulsion usually cannot be reversed.
 11.4.4.2 	Expelled players may attend public demos, but only as spectators.
 11.4.4.3 	Site fees and/or donations will not be refunded to a player if they 
expelled from play.
 11.4.4.4 	A panel of three Game Masters voting unanimously is required to 
enforce an expulsion.

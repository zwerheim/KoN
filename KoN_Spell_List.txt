Albative Armor
Type: Enchantment
Level: 4
Duration: Game Day until discharged
Range: Touch
Dispel: Yes

This spell, when cast on a character’s physical armor, empowers that armor adding two points of 'Monstrous' universal armor. The player should only take one point of damage from the next two damaging attacks that hit his areas of armor coverage regardless of the source. The exception to this is if the damaging source has the 'Slay' descriptor, ignoring the 'Monstrous' ability and taking normal damage, or the 'Peirce' descriptor, bypassing the armor entirely and taking the hit to the body.
This spell can only be cast on armor, not on the player herself. If the character is wearing no armor, or only costume armor, then the spell has no effect. It also has no effect if the character is wearing only a helmet.

Abomination 
Level: 5 
Type: Necromancy 
Duration: Ten Minutes 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell causes the recipient’s to become resistant to damage as they take on some undead traits. The target gains the Monstrous type from the Monster Manual. This Monstrous effect mitigates all damage done to the Abomination, including damage done to armor and Magic Armor. In effect, anything that deals damage to the recipient will only deal one point (unless it has the ‘Slay’ descriptor). Monstrous Creatures may freely enter an area under the effects of an Unhallow spell for the duration spell. Monstrous creatures are immune to Pin effects and Pit traps, and can deal up to four damage while dual wielding weapons.

Anti-Magic Aura 
Level: 4 
Type: Aegis 
Duration: One Minute 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: No 

This spell crates a powerful magic field around the recipient of the spell that absorbs all magic spells, harmful or beneficial (including Restorative magic). The spell lasts for one minute and automatically negates any magic effects, or attacks with the 'Strike' descriptor, which hit the character. The player is required to announce “No effect” in a loud voice when they use this aura to ignore a spell. Characters protected by this spell are required to wear a blue armband as described in the chapter on magic and spell use. Anti-Magic Aura has no effect on attacks from magical weapons or creatures. Anti-Magic Aura does stop creature special abilities if they are defined as a “spell effect” such as the fear ability of a ghost. 


Anti-Magic Shield 
Level: 2 
Type: Aegis 
Duration: Game Day 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: Yes

This spell crates a powerful magic field around the recipient of the spell that absorbs offensive magic spells. The spell has one use and automatically negates the first offensive magic attack or attack with the 'Strike' descriptor that hits the character. The character has no choice in this matter and may not choose to save the Anti-Magic Shield for a later, perhaps more powerful spell. The player is required to announce “No effect” in a loud voice when they use this aura to ignore a spell. Characters protected by this spell are required to wear a blue armband as described in the chapter on magic and spell use. Anti-Magic Shield has no effect on attacks from magical weapons or creatures. Anti-Magic Shield does stop creature special abilities if they are defined as a “spell effect” such as the fear ability of a ghost. 

Aura of Reflection 
Type: Aegis 
Level: 5 
Duration: Game Day 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell crates a powerful magic field around the recipient of the spell that reflects offensive magic spells. The spell has one use and automatically reflects the first two (2) offensive magic attacks, or attacks with the 'Strike' descriptor that hit the character. The spell is automatically reflected back at the character that cast the original spell and does not require the use of a tag bag or weapon (in the case of touch ranged attacks). The ‘Caster’ of a reflected spell is the defender. If the original caster of the spell is also protected by an Aura of Reflection, the spell is dispelled and has no further effect. If the original caster is no longer in range of the spell or out of the vision of the character with Aura of Reflection, the offensive spell simply ends. 
The character has no choice in this matter and may not choose to save the Aura of Reflection for a later, perhaps more powerful spell. A player is required to announce “Reflect!” in a loud voice when this spell is used. Characters protected by this spell are required to wear a blue armband as described in the chapter on magic and spell use. Aura of Reflection has no effect on attacks from magical weapons or creatures. Aura of Reflection does reflect creature special abilities if they are defined as a “spell effect” such as the fear ability of a ghost. Some creatures are immune to their own special abilities and in this case a reflected ability is simply dispelled. 

Banish
Type: Nature
Level: 4
Duration:  10 minutes
Range:  Tag-bag
Dispel:  Yes   (requires the ability to see through dissipate!)

This spell creates a single dart of magical energy that ‘force-Dissipates’ the enemy. The victim acts as though under the effects of Dissipate, though they cannot break free of the ability. Additionally, unlike Dissipate, the caster knows where the subject will reappear once the spell expires. At the completion of the spell’s duration, the person may act freely as if nothing happened to them. If the target has a blue flag, they should raise it above their heads as if they were in a dissipate spell.

Battle Mastery 
Type: Battle 
Level: 5
Duration: Game Day
Range: self 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell grants use of the following skills, regardless of prerequisites or actual character skills: 
Great Weapon Training 
Melee Training 
Missile Training 
Thrown Weapon Training 
Two Weapon Fighting Master 
Buckler
Shield

Battle Mastery does not allow a player to hit for more than one point of damage if that player does not have the skills to do so; it simply allows him to use any weapons at hand.
 Battle Mastery also grants immunity to magic damage, and is treated as an 'immunity' spell for rules purposes. A player enhanced by this spell is required to wear a blue flag as explained in the Magic & Spells section. 

Charm 
Type: Compulsion 
Level: 2 
Duration: Ten Minutes 
Range: Tag Bag 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell creates a shimmering dart of energy that the caster throws at a target in an attempt to transfix and charm it. A target that is hit by this dart is overcome with a powerful feeling of friendship towards the caster. If the dart strikes a target’s weapon or shield the spell still takes full effect. The spell lasts for ten minutes during which the target will not harm or conspire to bring harm to the caster. Charm does not allow the caster to issue commands to the charmed target or otherwise compel it to act in any other way. The charmed target will not act in a fashion that will bring harm to themselves or their party members in an attempt to protect the caster. For example, the caster cannot ask a charmed person to set their weapons down in the middle of a battle! In most cases, the charmed target will simply move away from the caster and leave them alone. The charm ends immediately if the caster attacks or facilitates an attack on the charmed target. For example, if the caster orders his or her party to attack the charmed target. Simply drawing a weapon or starting to cast an offensive spell in the presence of the charmed target does not warrant the charm being broken unless the caster directly voices their intention to attack the charmed player. A charmed target will not give up its possessions without good reason, though they might sell or barter them away to the caster for a better price than they would under normal circumstances. 

Creeping Rot 
Type: Necromancy 
Level: 2
Duration: Instant
Range: Tag Bag
Dispel: Yes

This spell calls into existence two (2) darts of non-magical energy or endow a weapon with poison for ten minutes. This dart, upon striking a target, will deal 4 poison damage to the area hit. This spell is NOT stopped by anti-magic defenses as it is not a magical effect. However, this spell CAN be resisted by Spirit Shield and Poison Immunity and CAN be blocked with a normal shield. The dart must be used within one minute after casting this spell or the dart will automatically dispel and is wasted. If you chose to endow a weapon, the enchantment lasts ten minutes. The weapon hits for poison damage. This spell does not increase the damage of the attack. It is legal for a character to fight with two endowed weapons, one in each hand. A blue flag must be visible, attached the lower part of the blade or cross guards (lower shaft of pole arms and maces), attached to the staff of the bow, or stock of the crossbow of the endowed weapon. Without the flag it is considered a normal weapon.

Devastation 
Type: Battle 
Level: 5 
Duration: Instant 
Range: Tag Bag 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell creates five (5) concentrated darts of magical force to be thrown at a target to inflict damage. The target hit by a Devastation dart receives four points of magical damage to the area hit. Hits to  an opponent’s shield or weapon count as hits to the arm holding the weapon or shield. The player is not allowed to set the dart down (this includes dropping the dart) and doing so will dispel the dart. The darts must be thrown to activate so the caster may not simply touch a target with a dart to inflict damage. One minute after casting this spell the dart automatically dispels and are wasted.
Darts created by the Devastation spell ignore the Monstrous ability. Because of this, targets under the effects of  abomination, wearing plate armor, or monsters that naturally possess the Monstrous ability take the full four points of damage from a Devastation dart. The damage call for this spell is “Four Magic Slay!”
 
Diagnosis 
Type: Restorative 
Level: 1 
Duration: instant 
Range: touch 
Dispel: n/a 

This spell allows the caster to immediately discern all ailments afflicting the target, including poisons, disease, madness, magical afflictions or sickness. If cast upon a corpse, it will reveal the cause and method of death and whether or not there is a spark present. Casting Diagnosis protects the caster from catching any harmful afflictions while being used to examine the subject.

Disengage 
Type: Compulsion 
Level: 1 
Duration: One Minute 
Range: Tag Bag 
Dispel: Yes 

Disengage creates a red ball of compulsive power that can be hurled at a target to prevent them from attacking you. When struck with this spell, a target will not engage the caster with physical or magical attacks for one minute. During this time they are free to attack other people or take other actions, and they do not forget that the caster cast a hostile spell on them. 
If at any time the caster attacks the target, or even moves within five feet of the target with an unsheathed weapon or active spell, the effect is broken and the target is free to once again attack the caster if it wishes. 
The target is also afflicted with a mild compulsion to avoid the caster. This is not the effect of a Fear spell, but does prevent the target from breaking the effects of Disengage simply by moving towards the caster when they unsheathe a weapon or cast another spell. If it is clear the caster is forcing the target to move closer to him or herself, the spell will break. It is impossible for the caster to herd the target around the battlefield with this spell, and any attempts to use Disengage in a hostile manner will break the effects of the spell. 

Dispel Magic
Type: Enchantment
Level: 4
Duration: Instant
Range: Tag Bag
Dispel: N/A

This spell creates a powerful dart of focused anti-magic that the caster can use to disrupt the magical defenses of a target. When a target not protected by Anti Magic Aura is hit by this spell, all magical effects currently active on the person, including their items are dispelled. Tinkering Items are also suppressed for ten minutes. After that time they must be activated again to be used.
	The caster must throw the dart for the spell to take effect and may not simply touch the tag bag to a target. Examples of magical effects include Curse, Magic Armor, Battle Mastery, or Abomination. 
	It is also possible to target a magical field with Dispel Magic, such as a Sanctuary or Sanctify. To do so simply requires the caster hit the object protected by the field or anywhere inside the field’s area of effect. Magical fields gain no benefit from any magical auras their caster might have active at the time. Once defenses are dispelled, they may be recast at any time assuming the target has the means to do so. 
	It is possible for this spell to affect other scenario specific magic, but a Game Master will deal with these situations on a case-by-case basis. Dispel Magic will also counteract the effects of any other single individual spell marked as able to be dispelled in the rules, assuming the caster can hit the target with a tag bag. If there is more than one effect that can be affected by Dispel Magic the caster must know and designate the one he wants dispelled. As a rule of thumb, Dispel Magic affects only creatures and their spells.

Dissipate
Type: Nature
Level: 2
Duration: Ten Minutes
Range: Touch
Dispel: No

This spell allows the caster to merge with any surrounding element by magically melding with it. When casting the spell, the character is required to touch the element (in the case of water or earth, in the case of air and fire, holding out one’s hand towards the element is sufficient) with one hand and hold a blue flag over the head with the other hand. The character is then invulnerable to the outside world. At the same time the character cannot interact with the outside world in any fashion until they leave the dissipated state. No action may be taken while inside the earth (drinking potions, casting spells, or drawing a weapon). Other characters are required to ignore the dissipated character even if they see the caster disappear into thin air. Witnesses dismiss this magic effect as losing site of the caster in the woods or some other rationale. The spell ends if the caster decides to reform, if the blue flag drops below their head or the when the duration of the spell expires. The character must reform in the same spot they dissipated. This spell does not allow the caster to move to a new location. Only the character’s personal and hand held objects dissipate with them and all those objects reform with them.

Dominate 
Type: Compulsion 
Level: 5 
Duration: Ten Minutes 
Range: Tag Bag 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell creates a softly glowing pink dart of concentrated willpower. A target struck with a Dominate spell falls under the direct control of the caster, much in the same manner as an Undead under the control of a Lesser Command spell. The target has no knowledge that they are under a dominate spell and must RP accordingly. Only three commands are legal to use with the controlled being. They are, “Attack”, “Defend”, “Move”, or ‘Stop”(as in “stop talking”). See the spell description for Lesser Command for full explanation of these commands. 
In addition, living creatures who are dominated are allowed to deal themselves a killing blow at any time to represent their final act of defiance to their controller, or to avoid taking an action they cannot morally accept, such as murdering someone. 

Elemental Dart 
Type: Nature 
Level: 3 
Duration: Instant 
Range: Tag Bag 
Dispel: n/a 

This spell creates either two darts of focused elemental power in the form of nature that is primarily intended to harm elemental creatures, or a single dart of Primal energy to harm the strongest of elementals. The caster may choose which of the type of damage the dart will manifest as when they cast the spell. The spell will either manifest two darts that inflict four Nature damage, or a single dart that inflicts four Primal Damage. This damage is magical and does affect creatures only harmed by magic. Elemental Dart cannot perform any other function other than inflicting damage. For example an Elemental Dart of fire cannot start fires or serve as a light source. The player is not allowed to pass an Elemental Dart off to other players or set a dart down (this includes dropping them) and doing so will dispel the dart. The Elemental Darts must be thrown to activate so the caster may not simply touch a target with a dart to inflict damage. One minute after casting this spell the Elemental Darts automatically dispels and is wasted. 

Elemental Weapon 
Type: Nature 
Level: 3 
Duration: Game Day 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell channels elemental energy through their (and only their) non-magical melee weapon. The spell will function on any size hand weapon, but the caster using the weapon to channel elemental power must still possess the necessary skills to wield a weapon of that size. The spell will not work on missile weapons, thrown weapons, shields, or non-weapon objects. 
For the duration of the spell, the weapon hits for 'Nature' damage. This spell does not increase the damage of the attack. Elemental damage allows a weapon to damage certain creatures normally unaffected by any form of physical attack, such as trolls, certain fae, and the various elementals. It also causes extra damage to certain other creatures. Elemental weapons cannot bear blade poisons or any other enchantments while in an elemental state. A blue flag must be visible, attached the lower part of the blade or cross guards (lower shaft of pole arms and maces) of the Elemental Weapon, and without the flag it is considered a normal weapon. 

Enchant Shield 
Type: Enchantment 
Level: 2 
Duration: Game Day 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell enchants a normal shield with mystical energy protecting it and its wielder from harm. The size of the shield does not matter in regards to this spell; it will work on any game legal shield. When cast on a normal shield the shield is immune to the very next tag bag attack that strikes it. Normally, tag bag delivered attacks, such as Battle Magic darts, count as hits to the arm when they strike a shield. The wielder of the shield is required to announce “No effect” in a loud voice when they use the shield to ignore a tag bag. This spell does not allow the caster to use a shield if their character does not normally have the skill to do so. A shield protected by this spell is required to have a blue flag visibly attached to it surface, and without the flag is considered a normal shield. 

Enchant Weapon 
Type: Enchantment 
Level: 3 
Duration: Ten Minutes 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell endows a single, non-magical weapon with a sheath of magical energy. The spell will function on any size melee weapon or missile weapon, but the character using the weapon must still possess the necessary skills to wield a weapon of that size. The spell will not work on shields or non-weapon objects. For ten minutes the weapon hits for elven steel damage. This spell does not increase the damage of the attack. It is legal for a character to fight with two endowed weapons, one in each hand. Endowed weapons cannot bear blade poisons or other enchantments while enchanted. A blue flag must be visible, attached the lower part of the blade or cross guards (lower shaft of pole arms and maces), attached to the staff of the bow, or stock of the crossbow of the endowed weapon. Without the flag it is considered a normal weapon.





Fear 
Type: Compulsion 
Level: 4 
Duration: Ten Minutes 
Range: Tag Bag 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell creates a focused dart of howling spirits that flit around and terrorize its target, frightening them away from the caster. A target that is hit by Fear is so gripped with terror that they must flee without hesitation from the caster’s sight until the spell ends, at which time they may return. The victim is not permitted to hide behind an obstacle or another player to avoid the sight of the caster; they must flee with all possible speed. If other players try to block the fleeing player, they will attack friend or foe without mercy or restraint in their attempt to continue escaping. The target will flee in a direction even if it means possible harm or death. For example a fleeing target would run straight into a pit if it were the only viable avenue of escape. It is legal for the caster to chase after the target forcing them to continue running if they feel it is necessary. If for some reason all possible means of escape are blocked, such as in a locked room, the target will fall to the ground helpless and should role-play digging through the very floor to attempt escape! If at any time the caster attacks the target the spell immediately ends and the target is free to act as normal. Other players may attack the target without ending the spell though the target is permitted to attack back assuming the attackers are blocking their route of escape. The fleeing target will not stop to make use of magic objects or spells while they are running; they must wait for the spell to end. 

Ghastly Visage
Type: Necromancy
Level: 1
Duration: Ten Minutes
Range: Touch
Dispel: Yes

This spell makes its target appear to be a lesser undead to other undead. To other living creatures, the target appears normal. The target gains no undead abilities, benefits or drawbacks. The recipient of the spell must choose what type of lesser undead to appear as when the spell is cast.
Note that creatures under the effects of Ghastly Visage may freely enter an area under the effects of an Unhallow spell for the duration of the Ghastly Visage effect.

Greater Command 
Type: Necromancy 
Level: 5 
Duration: Ten Minutes 
Range: Tag Bag 
Dispel: Yes 

Greater Command creates two darts of necromantic power that allows the caster to exert control over greater undead creatures. The spell has no effect on unique undead lords, but will affect lesser undead if the caster deems it necessary to waste a higher-level spell to do so. If the dart strikes a greater undead it falls under the direct control of the caster for ten minutes or until destroyed. They can then be commanded in the same manner as Lesser Command allows. 
The controlled undead will not attack the caster that controls it unless for some reason they order it to do so. Since greater undead are very often highly intelligent they are able to remember the actions they took while under control of the caster. 

Grounding 
Type: Nature 
Level: 1
Duration: Ten Minutes
Range: Tag Bag
Dispel: Yes

This spell creates a dart of magical energy that is hurled at a target. If struck, the target is unable to utilize extraplanar movement and effects or magical disguises. Grounding prevents or dispels the following spells:
?Dissipate
?Banish
?Reap Spirit
?Ghastly Visage
?Ley Lines
Note that Grounding can only prevent the effects of casting Dissipate, Reap Spirit or Ley Lines, it cannot dispel those spells.

Heal Body
Type: Restoration
Level: 1
Duration: Instant
Range: Touch
Dispel: N/A

This spell fills the recipient with pure life force that is capable of healing minor injuries. This spell restores a character to their full number of Body points but has no effect on limb or torso wounds. The spell will never raise a character’s Body points above their current maximum or grant Body points to a character that has none. It is not possible to heal a character’s Body if they are still suffering from a limb or torso wound, or from the effects of any damage dealt by a poison, as those injuries must receive healing or an antidote first. This spell will not heal a character that is suffering from disease unless they are first cured with a Purify Spirit spell, or poisons unless they are first treated with an antidote or a Purify Spirit spell

Heal Mortal Wound 
Type: Restorative 
Level: 3 
Duration: Instant 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: N/A 

This spell fills the recipient with an incredibly pure, powerful life force that is capable of healing mortal wounds. When cast on a character with a torso wound, they are healed of this injury and are no longer in danger of bleeding to death. This spell has no effect on a character that has already died, does not heal limb wounds, and does not restore Body points. A character suffering from a torso wound cannot use this spell since a torso wound automatically disrupts their ability to cast magic even before they die. It is possible to heal a character’s torso wound even if they are suffering from other injuries such as wounded limbs or lost Body points. This spell will not heal a character that is suffering from a disease or the effects of poison unless they are first cured with a Purify Spirit spell.

Improved Magic Armor

Type: Aegis 
Level: 3 
Duration: Game Day or until expended 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell functions as Magic Armor, but grants the recipient four points of protection. Improved Magic Armor always overlaps Magic Armor; it will never stack to grant more than four points of magical protection. If Improved Magic Armor is cast on a target that already has Magic Armor, this spell effectively dispels and replaces the Magic Armor spell already active, wasting it. 

Lesser Command
Type: Necromancy
Level: 4
Duration: Ten Minutes
Range: Tag Bag
Dispel: Yes
Lesser Command creates four darts of necromantic power that allow the caster to exert control over lesser undead creatures. The spell has no effect on undead lords or greater undead. If the dart strikes a lesser undead it then falls under the direct control of the caster for ten minutes or until destroyed. Only three commands are legal to use with the controlled undead. They are, “Attack”, “Defend”, or “Move”.
Attack: The attack command allows the caster to point at a target and compels the undead to attack it. The undead will attack any target, even other undead. The undead will attack the target without question or concern for its own preservation and will use every available power and ability to carry out the attack. It is possible to word the attack command in a fashion that will compel the undead to attack multiple targets.
For example the caster could order the undead to, “attack all zombies”. 
Defend: A defend command works like an attack command, but the caster orders the undead to defend something such as a person. In this case the undead will attack anything that comes near the object or person it was ordered to defend. The undead will never move more than five feet from the object it was ordered to defend. Like an attack command it is possible to word the defend order in a fashion that will compel the undead to defend multiple targets or large areas. For example, the caster could order the undead to, “defend all living things in the town”.
Move: A move command simply compels the undead to move in a direction of the caster’s choice for the duration of the spell. It is legal for the caster to order the undead to follow them or walk in front of them. The undead will move at any speed the caster desires and it is physically able to do. The undead will only walk/run/float when under orders to move. The undead is not capable of climbing, crawling, swimming or any other sort of movement. The undead will not perform even the simplest of action such as the opening of a door or dropping their weapons. The undead will move into a situation that might cause it harm or injury, such as ordering a zombie to walk into an open pit.
The controlled undead will not attack the caster that controls it unless for some reason they order it to do so.

Ley Lines
Type: Nature
Level: 5
Duration: Instant
Range: self
Dispel: No

By binding a tiny portion of the caster’s life spark to a physical location, Ley Lines allows the caster to    instantly travel back to that location by dissipating their body into natural energies that travel along the ley power lines of Novitas.
Upon learning this spell, the caster performs a small ceremony (it may be role-played if desired) that binds himself to the physical location he is at. This location may be changed at will, but only between events (except with GM permission). It must be a static physical location, such as “this large rock” or “this big tree”, and not another person or object.
When casting this spell, upon completion of the incant the caster is instantly removed from that particular encounter and may not rejoin it for the duration of the event. If necessary call a game hold to remove yourself from the area. The caster is now out of game until he reaches his binding location, at which time he reappears. The caster should be marked with orange to signify that he is out of game. A Game Master may require you to remain out of game for a longer period of time. You must have empty hands when traveling. Any items that are to travel with you must be secured on your person. Only you may travel along the ley lines and you may not carry another person, or cast this spell upon another person.
The spell Grounding prevents this spell from functioning, and completing this spell while under the effects of a Grounding spell wastes the Magic Power with no effect.
While it is possible to scribe Ley Lines onto a scroll, there are limitations to this because of the magical mechanics of the spell. Once scribed, such a scroll will only work for the caster who produced it, and no one else.

Maelstrom
Type: Battle
Level: 4
Duration: Instant
Range: Tag Bag
Dispel: N/A

This spell creates five (5) magic darts to be thrown at a target inflicting damage. The target hit by
a maelstrom  receives four points of Magic damage per dart to the area hit. Any hits to an opponent’s shield or weapon count as hits to the arm holding the weapon or shield. The player is not allowed to set the dart down (this includes dropping the dart) and doing so will dispel the dart. The darts must be thrown to activate so the caster may not simply touch a target with a dart to inflict damage. One minute after casting this spell the darts automatically dispel and so are wasted.

Mageblade
Type: Battle
Level: 2
Duration: 10 minutes
Range: Target Weapon Touched

	This spell imbues the targeted weapon with the ability to function as a Mageblade.  A Mageblade lets a spell be channeled through the weapon instead of a tagbag.  For instance, Romulus the Battle Mage could channel a Slaying Swarm through his Mageblade, and when he strikes it would deal "4 Magic Slay Strike".  Magebladed spells "go off" on legal body hits, AKA a strike which would injure an unarmored player.  Note that Mageblade does not increase the normal 1 minute window between spell casting and when a spell fizzles if it hasn't been used.

Magic Lock
Type: Enchantment
Level: 1
Duration: Game Day
Range: Touch
Dispel: Yes

This spell will hold shut any one portal such as a window, door, or trunk lid for the duration of the spell. A caster cannot use a magic lock to hold a portal open, only closed. Magic Lock renders the portal invulnerable to damage or tampering for the duration of the spell. A portal protected by a Magic Lock must have a visible blue flag attached to it with the words “Magic Lock” and the time when the spell was cast written on it. Without this flag the portal is considered unsecured.

Magic Strike 
Type: Battle
Level: 1
Duration: Ten Minutes 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell sheaths a single melee weapon with powerful magical energy. The spell will channel through any size weapon so long as the character has the skills necessary to wield them. This spell adds the 'Strike' descriptor to the attack. The player is required to announce "4 Magic Strike" when a legal hit is landed. Anti-Magic Aura and Anti-Magic Shield will protect a target from this spell, negating all damage done with the strike. Aura of Reflection will also negate the damage, causing the attack to be reflected. The spell does not function with missile weapons, non-weapon hand held objects (a potion bottle, book, etc.) or shields, and may not be delivered with the caster’s bare hand. The spell does not go off if an opponent hits the caster, only if the caster strikes a target. The caster has no choice when to use the spell and it activates on the very next target they strike. The spell does not go off if the opponent blocks the caster’s weapon with a weapon or shield nor is the spell wasted. This spell cannot be combined with any other damage increasing ability or power; four points is the maximum damage of any attack. 


Memory Loss
Type: Compulsion
Level: 3
Duration: permanent
Range: Tag Bag
Dispel: Yes

A being struck by a Memory Loss dart instantly loses all recollection of the events of the previous ten minutes. Memory Loss must be diagnosed to be removed, and becomes fully permanent at the end of the following event. Under these restrictions, it can be removed by Dispel Magic or another Memory Loss casting. The original caster does not need to diagnose it, and may remove it by successfully casting another Memory Loss to undo his casting. If the subject has been affected by several Memory Loss effects, they can all be diagnosed at once but each must be removed individually. Once permanent, it can no longer be Diagnosed or removed.
	Physical damage remains, power points expended are still used, and items used or destroyed are still gone. The target will simply concoct some reason why things are the way they are, and no amount of logic or reasoning will ever make the subject remember the lost ten minutes. This spell takes some amount of cooperation from the target. Players who are failing to play in the spirit of this spell will be directed by a Game Master how to better roleplay their loss of memory.

Mend Armor
Type: Nature
Level: 1
Duration: Instant
Range: Touch
Dispel: n/a

This spell draws upon the raw power of the elements to restore damaged armor to working condition. When cast on a character wearing damaged physical armor (not spell created armor), the armor is restored to its normal number of armor points. Mend Armor will not raise a character’s armor points above their original value or grant armor points to a character that is not wearing armor. Mend armor can be used to repair a shield that has been damaged by a Vial of Acid. The shield must be taken of the arm and set down on the ground for the spell to be cast effectively. 

Mind Blank 
Type: Compulsion 
Level: 5 
Duration: Game Day 
Range: Touch

Natural Repulsion
Type: Nature 
Level: 2 
Duration: Ten Minutes 
Range: Tag Bag 
Dispel: Yes 

This spell creates four focused darts of elemental power that the caster can use to repel plants, animals, and lesser fae. A creature of that type hit by this spell must move away from the caster at their best possible speed. This effect is not properly described as fear, but instead is a simple desire to avoid the caster. The target must make every effort to leave the line of sight of the caster but will attack other targets that get in their way. Unlike the Fear spell, the creature is not compelled to attack friendly targets that block their route of escape but will not allow them to block their flight. The creatures will attack the caster if they are blocking the only open means of escape.

Nature’s Command
Type: Nature
Level: 4
Duration: Instant
Range: Tag Bag
Dispel: Yes

Nature’s Command creates two darts of elemental power that allow the caster to exert control over lesser elementals, plants, lesser fae, etc. The spell has no effect on greater elementals or high fae. If the dart strikes a target it then falls under the direct control of the caster for ten minutes or until destroyed. Only three commands are legal to use with the controlled target. They are “Attack”, “Defend”, or “Move”. 
Attack: The attack command allows the caster to point at a target and compels the creature to attack it. The commanded creature will attack any target. It will attack the target without question or concern for its own preservation and will use every available power and ability to carry out the attack. It is possible to word the attack command in a fashion that will compel the creature to attack multiple targets. For example the caster could order the creature to “attack all humans”. 
Defend: A defend command works like an attack command but the caster orders the creature to defend a specific person, place, or thing. In this case the creature will attack anything that comes near the object or person it was ordered to defend. It will never move more than five feet from the object it was ordered to defend. Like an attack command it is possible to word the defend order in a fashion that will compel the creature to defend multiple targets or large areas (e.g. the caster could order the creature to “defend all living things in the town”).
Move: A move command simply compels the creature to move in a direction of the caster’s choice for the duration of the spell. It is legal for the caster to order the creature to follow them or walk in front of them. It will move at any speed the caster desires and it is physically able to do. The creature will not perform even the simplest of actions such as the opening of a door or dropping of weapons. The controlled creature will not attack the caster that controls it unless ordered to do so.

The target is otherwise unhindered and may turn and twist in any fashion they like so long as they do not move their feet. The surface the character is standing on has no effect on this spell it will adhere the target’s feet to anything, nor will standing on one foot, jumping in the air, or any other form of acrobatics, protect against this spell. It is assumed that the magic forces the player’s feet to the ground the moment the spell hits them. If the player is on their knees the spell will adhere their knees to the ground in place of their feet. There is no way the target can tear their feet from the ground, dig their way out, cut off their feet, or remove their shoes.

Reap Spirit 
Type: Necromancy 
Level: 1
Duration:  (Special)
Range:  Touch
Dispel:  No

This spell causes a Killing Blow if cast upon a mortally wounded recipient. The caster of this spell absorbs the life-spark from the once-living target. When a body has had its spirit ‘reaped’ it cannot be revived unless the spirit is returned. If the caster is in proximity of the recipient of the spell, a Medium may pull the spirit out of the caster and force it back into the original owner’s body. In addition, the death of the caster releases the spirit which is then returned to the original target of the spell. Only Mediums are able to see this stolen life-spark on the caster of Reap Spirit. To do so, the Medium would say, “I am a Medium, are you holding any spirits?” (This would be an out-of-game conversation). If the life-spark is not returned to the body by the end of the next Game Day then the effect becomes permanent (thus preventing the target from ever being revived). This length of time may span between two Events if need be. Casters of this spell are expected to remain in play to allow an opportunity to return the spirit back to its owner. If the caster already holds a spark from a previous Reap Spirit. The spell will cause a Killing Blow on the target, but the spark will not be removed and the target is still able to be healed. This spell will still kill creatures that have Reap Spirit as it's Kill Condition if the caster is holding a spark and cannot take another. If cast upon an Undead target, the life force of the creature is far too weak to be absorbed into the caster and is destroyed, therefore preventing the reanimation of the undead creature.  

Repel Undead 
Type: Necromancy 
Level: 2 
Duration: Ten Minutes

Dispel: Yes

An undead hit by this spell must move away from the caster at their best possible speed. This effect is not properly described as fear, but instead is a simple desire to avoid the caster. The target must make every effort to leave the line of sight of the caster but will attack other targets that get in their way. Unlike the Fear spell, the undead is not compelled to attack friendly targets that block their route of escape but will not allow them to block their flight. The undead will attack the caster if they are blocking the only open means of escape such as the caster standing in the doorway of a tomb.

Resilience
Type: Restoration
Level: 3

Restore Limb

Duration: Instant 
Range: Touch

Revive 
Type: Restorative 
Level: 5 
Duration: Instant 
Range: Touch 
Dispel: No 

Revive is the most powerful of healing magic and is capable of returning a character from the edge of death. A character must receive a Revive before the end of the game day when their character fell from a torso wound, and if they fail to do so the character moves on to permanent death. When Revive is cast on a fallen character the character returns to consciousness free of all previous injuries and illness. The spell heals all lost body points, limb wounds, the effects of disease, poison, and most other ailments. Revive does not restore a character’s expended power points if they had any before falling, nor does it restore a player’s expended scrolls, poison, Alchemy products, or magic objects. All protective spells, such as Magic Armor, end when a character falls, and are not restored when they are Revived. The character feels no ill effects from this recovery and may continue on as normal. They retain their complete memories up to the point of their collapse and are permitted to act on this information assuming they do not meta-game details they may have discovered after that. For reasons of in game consistency, it is assumed that Revive is unable to reverse the effects of normal aging. 
Revive will not raise a character that has had a Reap Spirit spell cast on them. A piece of the body present at the time of death is required for Revive. If any part of a character’s body had Reap Spirit cast on it, then the entire body is ineligible for Revive until their spirit is returned, as per the Reap Spirit spell.

Range: Tag Bag

This spell calls into existence four (4) darts of non- magical energy or endow a blade with acid for ten minutes. These darts, upon striking a target, will deal 4 acid damage. This spell is NOT stopped by anti-magic defenses as it is not a magical effect. However, this spell CAN be resisted by Spirit Shield and Poison Immunity. The darts must be used within one minute after casting this spell or the darts will automatically disappear and is wasted.  Note that since these darts are non-magical, they cannot be channeled through a mageblade. If you chose to endow a weapon, the enchantment lasts ten minutes. The weapon hits for acid damage.

A blue flag must be visible, attached the lower part of the blade or cross guards (lower shaft of pole arms and maces), attached to the staff of the bow, or stock of the crossbow of the endowed weapon.

Sanctify will not protect temporary buildings such as a tent or open air extensions to buildings such as a porch. When cast on a building, all of the building’s doors and windows glow with magical energy and no undead regardless of their level may enter. Anti-Magic Aura, Anti- Magic Shield and Aura of Reflection will not allow an undead to pass through the barrier, but a Dispel Magic spell will drop the Sanctify. This spell does not prevent undead from casting spells or firing missile weapons into the protecting building. The caster must be inside the building when the spell is cast but may come and go as they please once the spell is in place. The spell will force out any undead that are in a building once the spell is cast.

If the caster fails to do this, the spell fails and undead may freely move in and out of the building.

Sanctuary
Type: Aegis
Level: 3
Duration: Ten Minutes
Range: Touch
Dispel: Yes

Sanctuary creates a twenty-foot diameter bubble of magical force, focused on a spot indicated by the caster. Even though the bubble appears as a dome, it in fact is assumed to form a complete bubble with the lower half manifesting below the ground.
This prevents attempts to tunnel under the Sanctuary in order to attack the people inside. In order to use this spell, the caster must place a blue flag or tag bag on the ground indicating the center of the Sanctuary. The Sanctuary does not move from that point and the
caster must stay within the spell’s area effect or the Sanctuary will drop. The caster may move around inside the Sanctuary without ending the spell as long as they stay in its area of effect. The Sanctuary can enclose other people as long as they remain inside the spell’s area of effect. If an occupant other than the caster decides to leave the Sanctuary, the spell does not end and that player may not reenter the Sanctuary. Players, friend or foe, within ten feet of  the Sanctuary's center at the time of its creation are automatically enclosed in the bubble. A caster is not permitted to cast a new Sanctuary until the old one has ended so there is always a gap in protection between castings of this spell. If the Sanctuary is raised in a place where a twenty-foot diameter bubble would not have room to form, such as a tunnel, it is assumed to manifest completely but will not affect adjoining areas that might contain other players.
Once cast, only magic spells can enter or leave the Sanctuary. This allows magic users to cast from inside the bubble but also makes them vulnerable to magical attack from the outside. All other forms of attack and people who attempt to enter the Sanctuary are forcibly repulsed away. Gasses will not enter the Sanctuary but it is assumed that the bubble contains enough air to support any number of people for the duration of the spell.

The darts must be thrown to activate so the caster may not simply touch a target with a dart to inflict damage. One minute after casting this spell the dart automatically dispels and is wasted.

Spellburst
Type: Enchantment
